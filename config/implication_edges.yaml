# Manual mapping of implication edges to entities
# implications.yaml uses file names in derived_from, not entity IDs
# This config maps derived_from → source entities and affects → target entities

IMP01:
  derived_from:
    - compatibility  # All compatibility data (not a single entity, so we skip this)
  affects:
    # These are abstract concepts, not entities in our graph

IMP02:
  derived_from:
    - compatibility  # compatibility.yaml meta-challenge matrix
  affects:
    - M1  # Ambient Monitor and Intervene
    - M2  # Passive Capture and Structured Delivery
    - M6  # Periodic Injection

IMP03:
  derived_from:
    - compatibility

IMP07:
  derived_from:
    - compatibility
  affects:
