# S6 Supplement: ADHD Productivity App Landscape

## Methodology Note

Comprehensive sweep of ADHD-specific and ADHD-marketed productivity apps conducted 2026-02-06. Research sources included: roundup articles (ADDitude Magazine, AuDHD Psychiatry, Saner.AI, Fluidwave, Morgen, AFFiNE), directories (ToolFinder, Neurodiversity Directory, Apps for ADHD), community forums (Reddit r/ADHD, Hacker News), Product Hunt launches, Crunchbase/Tracxn/PitchBook funding data, TechCrunch coverage, and individual app websites. Scope is limited to **productivity tools** (task management, focus, scheduling, body doubling, voice capture, meeting notes, project management). Therapeutic/clinical apps (CBT-based symptom management like Inflow, medication trackers like Medisafe) and pure coaching services (Shimmer) are noted but not deep-dived.

### Positioning Insights

1. **Single-problem ADHD specialists** are almost all indie/bootstrapped. None has raised >$1M or achieved >50K paying users. The tools are beloved but tiny.

2. **Multi-problem ADHD platforms** are the emerging competitive battleground. Tiimo leads with Apple App of Year 2025 and $6M raised, but has not yet reached Series A. Lunatask, Saner.AI, and Amazing Marvin compete here but all remain small.

3. **General tools marketed to ADHD** capture most of the funding. Motion ($75M), Reclaim ($9.5M), and Endel ($22M) are general-purpose but lean into ADHD marketing. This is where VC money flows because TAM is larger.

4. **Body doubling is its own thriving vertical.** Five funded platforms compete (FLOWN, Flow Club, Focusmate, Deepwrk, Caveday) plus free options (BodyDoubling.space). UK Access to Work funding is a major growth driver for FLOWN and Deepwrk.

5. **Voice capture is fragmented and no ADHD-specific leader exists.** Multiple tools (Voicy, Brain Dump, Audionotes, Willow) serve the voice-first capture need but none has achieved meaningful scale or ADHD-specific traction.

## 4. Gaps: Problems With No ADHD-Specific Tool

Mapping against our problem IDs from S3:

| Problem ID | Problem | Dedicated ADHD Tool Exists? | Best Available | Gap Assessment |
|------------|---------|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **FP01** Task Initiation | Partial | Goblin Tools (breakdown), Neurolist (one-at-a-time), body doubling platforms | Multiple tools address task breakdown, but **no tool specifically targets the initiation moment** (the gap between knowing what to do and starting). Body doubling is the closest but is session-based. |
| **FP02** Focus/Distraction | Yes (many) | Brain.fm, Endel, Focus Bear, Freedom, Forest, Opal, Sidekick | **Most crowded category.** Focus audio and distraction blocking are well-served. Remaining gap: **adaptive, context-aware focus support** that responds to real-time attention state. |
| **FP03** Time Blindness | Partial | Tiimo, Weel, Structured, Llama Life | Several visual timer/planner tools exist. Gap: **no tool provides real-time "time elapsed" awareness during tasks** (most only show upcoming schedule, not how long you've been on current task vs. plan). |
| **FP04** Deadline Misses | Partial | Motion, Reclaim (auto-scheduling around deadlines) | General tools handle this; **no ADHD-specific tool addresses the "deadline sprint" pattern** where all work happens in final hours. |
| **FP05** Prioritisation | Partial | Fluidwave, Amazing Marvin, Leantime | AI prioritisation exists but **no tool addresses interest-based nervous system** (the ADHD mechanism where urgency/novelty/interest override importance). |
| **FP06** Detail Errors | **NO** | Grammarly (general writing only) | **LARGEST GAP.** No ADHD-specific tool for attention-to-detail errors in workplace deliverables. Grammarly catches writing errors but not data entry errors, spreadsheet mistakes, code review oversights, or process-step omissions. |
| **FP07** Meeting Memory | **NO** (ADHD-specific) | Otter.ai, Fireflies, Granola (all general) | General meeting transcription is mature ($100M+ ARR at Otter, $1B at Fireflies) but **zero ADHD-specific meeting tools** exist. No tool addresses ADHD-specific problems like zoning out mid-meeting, failing to capture action items assigned to you, or forgetting verbal commitments. Recallify and Caption.Ed market to ADHD but are early-stage. |
| **FP08** Project Neglect | Partial | Leantime (Techstars '23, tiny) | **Significant gap.** Leantime is the only ADHD-specific PM tool and has $36K revenue. No tool addresses delay discounting or motivational decay in long-term projects. |
| **FP09** Email Management | **NO** (ADHD-specific) | Saner.AI (early), SaneBox/Boomerang (general) | **Major gap.** No ADHD-specific email tool addresses the prospective memory failure pattern (reading email, intending to respond, then forgetting). Saner.AI is attempting this but is pre-seed with mixed reviews. |
| **FP11** Documentation | **NO** | Goblin Tools (task breakdown), Voicy (dictation) | **Major gap.** No ADHD-specific tool for documentation paralysis -- the inability to write reports, update documentation, or complete written deliverables. Voice-first capture tools partially help but don't solve the synthesis/composition problem. |
| **FP12** Chronic Lateness | Partial | Focus Bear ("Late No More"), Tiimo, Brili | A few tools address this but **no dedicated ADHD lateness tool** with multi-alarm, preparation checklists, and travel time awareness combined. Weel Planner's multi-alarm feature is closest. |

### Summary of Gap Severity

| Gap Level | Problems | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **No ADHD tool at all** | FP06 (Detail Errors), FP07 (Meeting Memory), FP09 (Email), FP11 (Documentation) | These four problems have zero dedicated ADHD solutions. General tools exist but don't address ADHD-specific mechanisms. |
| **ADHD tools exist but tiny/emerging** | FP01 (Initiation), FP05 (Prioritisation), FP08 (Project Neglect), FP12 (Lateness) | Tools exist but are indie-scale (<$250K revenue, <50K users). No clear market leader. |
| **Well-served** | FP02 (Focus), FP03 (Time Blindness), FP04 (Deadlines) | Multiple tools with meaningful traction. Focus audio and visual planners are the most mature ADHD-specific categories. |

## 5. Implications for S6 Market Gap Assessment

### 5.1 Confirms S6 Core Thesis

This landscape sweep **strongly confirms** the S6 finding that the ADHD productivity app market is "noisy general, quiet specific." There are 50+ apps in this space, but:
- Only 5 ADHD-specific productivity apps have raised >$1M (Tiimo, FLOWN, Flow Club, Shimmer, Sidekick)
- No ADHD-specific productivity app has raised a Series A
- The most successful ADHD-specific apps (Tiimo, Amazing Marvin) are beloved but remain small-scale
- The best-funded apps (Motion, Endel, Reclaim) are general tools that market to ADHD users

### 5.2 Adjustments to S6 Scores

Based on this sweep, the following S6 scores should be **reinforced or adjusted**:

| Problem | S6 Market Gap Score | Adjustment | Reason |
|---------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| **FP06** (Detail Errors) | 6/15 | **Increase to 8-9** | This sweep found literally zero apps addressing this. The low S6 score was based on Grammarly existing, but Grammarly only covers writing errors, not data/process/review errors. |
| **FP07** (Meeting Memory) | 8/15 | **Confirm or increase to 9** | Despite Otter/Fireflies being massive, this sweep confirmed zero ADHD-specific meeting tools. The general tools don't solve zoning out or commitment tracking. |
| **FP09** (Email) | 8/15 | **Confirm** | Saner.AI is attempting ADHD email but is pre-seed with poor Google Play ratings. No other ADHD-specific email tool exists. |
| **FP11** (Documentation) | 10/15 | **Confirm** | Zero ADHD-specific documentation tools. Voice capture tools partially help but don't solve the synthesis problem. |
| **FP08** (Project Neglect) | 10/15 | **Confirm** | Leantime is the only player, still at $36K revenue. Gap remains massive. |

### 5.3 New Market Intelligence

**Body doubling is now a proven category** with $10M+ in combined funding and 100K+ combined users across FLOWN, Flow Club, Focusmate, Deepwrk, and Caveday. This is relevant to FP01 (Task Initiation) -- body doubling is the most successful intervention for initiation failure, but it's session-based and human-dependent. An AI equivalent or integration could be valuable.

**AI auto-scheduling is the fastest-growing adjacent category** (Motion: $75M raised, $550M valuation). This addresses FP03/FP04/FP05 but from a general-productivity angle. The ADHD-specific opportunity is to build AI scheduling that understands interest-based activation, hyperfocus patterns, and energy fluctuations -- not just calendar availability.

**The "ADHD app graveyard" problem is universal.** Across all community discussions, the #1 complaint is that apps work briefly then get abandoned. This suggests that **retention design** (not feature design) may be the critical differentiator. Leantime's emoji sentiment tracking and Amazing Marvin's strategy rotation are nascent attempts at this, but no one has cracked it.

**Voice-first capture is an underexploited modality.** Multiple ADHD experts recommend "capture thoughts before they disappear," but no ADHD-specific voice tool has meaningful traction. Brain Dump (iPhone only, indie) and Voicy (desktop only, indie) are the closest. This could be a horizontal capability integrated into a broader ADHD platform rather than a standalone product.

**UK Access to Work is an emerging distribution channel.** FLOWN, Deepwrk, Focus Bear, Caption.Ed, and Jamworks all leverage UK government grants (up to GBP 66,000 per person) to fund ADHD workplace tools. This is a concrete B2B2C channel that most ADHD apps have not yet exploited.

### 5.4 Competitive Positioning Implications for Humble

If Humble targets ADHD workplace automation, the landscape suggests:

1. **FP06 (Detail Errors), FP09 (Email), and FP11 (Documentation) are true white spaces** with zero ADHD-specific competition. These are the highest-conviction market gaps.

2. **FP07 (Meeting Memory) is a massive market with zero ADHD-specific players** -- but general competitors (Otter, Fireflies) have $100M+ ARR and $1B+ valuations. Entering here requires a clearly differentiated ADHD-specific angle (e.g., attention-state-aware capture, commitment tracking, post-meeting memory reinforcement).

3. **Avoid building another ADHD planner/task manager.** This is the most crowded ADHD-specific category with Tiimo, Amazing Marvin, Lunatask, Neurolist, Numo, Thruday, and others competing. None has broken out, suggesting the category may be oversaturated relative to its ability to retain users.

4. **Integration over isolation.** The most successful general tools (Motion, Sunsama, Akiflow) win by integrating with existing workflows (Gmail, Calendar, Slack, Asana). Any ADHD-specific tool should meet users where they already work rather than requiring them to adopt a new system.

5. **The AI moment is now.** AI capabilities (auto-prioritisation, auto-scheduling, voice-to-task, meeting summarisation) are the clearest differentiator between old-generation ADHD apps (Brili, Habitica) and new-generation ones (Motion, Saner.AI, Neurolist). AI can serve as the "external executive function" that ADHD users need.
