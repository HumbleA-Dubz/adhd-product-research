# S6B: Market Gap Layer — Competitive Landscape Analysis (Team B)

## Methodology Note

This document scores three functional problems on the **Market Gap Layer** from the ADHD Product Pathway Methodology. For each problem, five questions are scored based on competitive landscape research conducted via web search across app stores, product directories (Product Hunt, G2, Capterra), funding databases (Crunchbase, Tracxn, PitchBook), ADHD community forums (Reddit r/ADHD, ADDitude), and review aggregators.

**Market data reflects conditions as of February 2026.** The ADHD apps market was valued at approximately USD 2.08 billion in 2024 and is growing at 11.9-15.4% CAGR, projected to reach USD 7.5-10.3 billion by 2033-2035 (sources: Business Research Insights, Market Growth Reports, Global Growth Insights).

## FP02: Inconsistent Focus / Sustained Attention Failure

**Problem Score (from S3): 13/15**

### Q1: How noisy is the market? — Score: 1 (Very noisy)

**Assessment:** The focus/attention space is the most saturated segment of the ADHD productivity market. Dozens of general-purpose focus tools compete alongside a growing number of ADHD-specific entrants. The category spans Pomodoro timers, ambient sound/music apps, distraction blockers, body-doubling platforms, gamified focus tools, and AI-powered attention aids. A single review site (Saner.AI) tested 44 ADHD apps in this broad category. Marketing noise is high — nearly every ADHD-adjacent app claims to help with focus. Differentiation is extremely difficult because "focus" is the default selling point for the entire productivity app market, not just the ADHD segment.

**Evidence:**
- Saner.AI tested 44 apps and selected 22 as best for ADHD, many targeting focus
- Multiple "best ADHD apps" listicles each feature 7-16 products, with substantial overlap
- General-purpose focus tools (Forest, Focus@Will, Freedom, RescueTime) compete directly with ADHD-specific entries (Brain.fm, Tiimo, Numo, Saner.AI)
- The body-doubling subcategory alone includes Focusmate, Flow Club, Caveday, and Flown
- Every major task manager (Todoist, TickTick, Notion, ClickUp) now positions with ADHD-friendly messaging

### Q2: What products exist?

| **RescueTime** | Automatic time tracking with focus sessions and distraction blocking | General | Mature; $12/month, founded 2008, 5+ years in market |
| **Freedom** | Cross-device distraction blocker (websites, apps) | General | Mature; founded 2011, well-established |
| **Focus@Will** | Neuroscience-based music for focus with personalized channels | General (some ADHD claims) | Mature; founded 2013, subscription model |
| **Session** | Flexible focus timer (5-60+ min), no guilt mechanics, calendar integration | General (ADHD-friendly design) | Established |
| **Inflow** | CBT-based ADHD management app with coaching, community, skill-building | ADHD-specific (broader than focus) | Established; $13.3M raised (Series A $11M from Octopus Ventures), 100K+ downloads, founded 2020 |

### Q3: How mature are leading products? — Score: 2 (Mature)

**Assessment:** The focus/attention category has multiple mature players (Forest, RescueTime, Freedom — all 5+ years old, feature-complete) alongside well-funded ADHD-specific challengers (Tiimo at $5.99M raised, Inflow at $13.3M raised). The general focus app space is fully mature. The ADHD-specific focus subcategory is emerging-to-established, with Tiimo winning Apple's 2025 App of the Year award — a strong signal of category legitimation. Brain.fm has been operating since 2013 and recently achieved peer-reviewed validation. The combination of mature general players and increasingly funded ADHD-specific entrants makes this a difficult market to enter as a newcomer.

**Evidence:**
- Forest: founded 2014, millions of users, one-time purchase model
- RescueTime: founded 2008, 17+ years in market
- Freedom: founded 2011, 14+ years in market
- Tiimo: $5.99M raised, Apple App of the Year 2025, 50K+ paying subscribers
- Inflow: $13.3M raised, Series A in 2023, Y Combinator alumni
- Brain.fm: operating since 2013, NSF-funded research, peer-reviewed publication in Communications Biology

### Q4: ADHD user review effectiveness? — Score: 4 (Mixed-negative)

**Assessment:** ADHD users consistently report that standard focus tools fail because they assume consistent baseline attention — the core differentiator for FP02. The Pomodoro technique is a focal point of frustration: ADHD users report that 25-minute fixed intervals don't match variable attention patterns, timers interrupt hyperfocus, and rigid break schedules create transition problems. However, some tools receive genuinely positive reviews: Brain.fm's peer-reviewed ADHD study and strong user testimonials, body-doubling platforms (Focusmate, Flown) with consistent positive sentiment, and Tiimo's App of the Year recognition. The negative signal is strongest around the "nothing works consistently" theme — users describe cycling through tools because what works one day fails the next, which maps directly to the day-to-day variability that defines FP02.

**Evidence:**
- Pomodoro failures extensively documented: "25 minutes is arbitrary," "as soon as the timer goes off, my concentration is gone," standard timers "assume consistent cycles"
- Medium article specifically titled "Why Pomodoro Fails for ADHD" citing variable energy and attention
- Glassdoor community: user describes trying 3 project management apps/year, "go all in for two weeks... then completely forget they exist"
- Medium author deleted 47 productivity apps in 30 days — "decision fatigue" from too many tools
- One Reddit-cited summary: "most productivity apps are just digital procrastination"
- Positive: Brain.fm user reports "4.5-hour deep work session when I usually can't concentrate for longer than 30 minutes"
- Positive: Focusmate 5-star Trustpilot rating; users report "everything changed"
- Positive: Tiimo's 50K+ paying subscribers indicates retention
- Negative: Numo 3.13/5 on Google Play with subscription complaints

### Q5: Root cause of existing solution failures

**Primary failure pattern: Solutions assume consistent baseline attention that does not exist in ADHD.**

Specific root causes:

1. **Fixed-interval fallacy.** Pomodoro and timer-based tools impose rigid cycles (25 min on / 5 min off) that cannot adapt to the unpredictable oscillation between near-zero productivity and hyperfocus. One day 15-minute sprints work; the next, a 3-hour deep work block is needed. No existing tool dynamically detects and adapts to the user's current attention state.

2. **Novelty decay.** ADHD brains crave variance. Users describe a predictable cycle: discover tool, use intensely for 1-2 weeks (dopamine from novelty), abandon. Tools that work via a single mechanism (ambient sound, gamified timer, distraction blocking) lose effectiveness once the novelty wears off. One user described it as getting a "dopamine hit from setting up the system, but not from actually using it."

3. **Wrong unit of analysis.** Most focus tools address individual sessions (start timer, block distractions) but FP02 is about day-to-day variability across sessions. The user doesn't need help during a good focus period — they need help recognizing and responding to bad focus periods in real-time. No tool currently monitors attention quality across a workday and dynamically adjusts strategy based on current state.

4. **Guilt mechanics backfire.** Forest's dying tree, streak-breaking in habit apps, and overdue-task counts create shame spirals for ADHD users who already struggle with self-blame. The ADHD community explicitly identifies "guilt mechanics" as a design failure.

5. **Partial solutions, no integration.** Body doubling works for some sessions, music helps some days, blocking helps sometimes. But no product integrates multiple modalities and dynamically selects the right one based on the user's current attention state and the nature of the task. Users are left to be their own system integrators.

**The gap:** No product currently addresses the *variability* problem — the signature characteristic that distinguishes ADHD focus failure from general distraction. A tool that could detect current attention state (via behavioural signals, self-report, or passive monitoring) and dynamically adjust its intervention strategy would address a genuine unmet need.

### FP02 Summary Scores

| Question | Score | Confidence |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Q1: Market noise | 1 (Very noisy) | High |
| Q3: Product maturity | 2 (Mature) | High |
| Q4: ADHD effectiveness | 4 (Mixed-negative) | Moderate-High |
| **Market Gap Score** | **7/15** | |

**Interpretation:** Despite very high user dissatisfaction (Q4=4) driven by the variability problem, the extreme market noise (Q1=1) and product maturity (Q3=2) make this a very difficult market to enter. The gap is real but narrow — a new entrant would need a genuinely novel mechanism (variability-adaptive attention management) to differentiate from the dozens of existing players.

---

## FP08: Long-Term Project Neglect

**Problem Score (from S3): 12/15**

### Q1: How noisy is the market? — Score: 3 (Moderate)

**Assessment:** The project management market generally is extremely noisy (Asana, Monday.com, Jira, Trello, ClickUp, Notion, etc.), but the specific sub-problem of long-term project neglect — driven by delay discounting and motivational decay — is moderately noisy. There are many tools for *managing* projects but very few that address *why ADHD users systematically neglect long-term work*. The noise is moderate because ADHD-specific project management tools exist (Leantime, Amazing Marvin) but are few and small, and general-purpose tools heavily market ADHD-friendly features without addressing the core delay-discounting mechanism. The signal-to-noise ratio is better than FP02 because the problem is more specific.

**Evidence:**
- General PM market is saturated (Asana, Monday.com, Jira, Trello, ClickUp, Notion all have ADHD blog content)
- But ADHD-specific PM tools are limited: only Leantime is purpose-built for neurodivergent project management
- Amazing Marvin targets task management broadly for ADHD, not specifically long-term project completion
- Goblin Tools addresses task breakdown but not sustained project engagement
- No product found that specifically targets delay discounting or motivational decay over project timelines

### Q2: What products exist?

| Product | Description | ADHD-Specific? | Maturity |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Leantime** | Open-source PM tool built for neurodivergent users; includes emoji sentiment tracking for tasks, AI task decomposition, cognitive accessibility design | ADHD-specific | Emerging; Techstars '23, ~$140K non-dilutive funding, ~30K accounts, 1.8M Docker pulls, seeking seed |
| **Amazing Marvin** | Highly customizable task manager with 80+ toggleable "strategies"; gamification, procrastination tracking, "Top of Mind" desktop reminder | ADHD-specific | Established; 5+ years, devoted user base, strong ADHD community reputation, indie/bootstrapped |
| **Sunsama** | Minimalist daily planner with daily planning ritual, workload limits, and end-of-day reflection; strong ADHD user adoption | General (strong ADHD following) | Established; subscription model, active development |
| **Goblin Tools (Magic ToDo)** | AI-powered task breakdown with adjustable "spiciness" for granularity; also includes Estimator, Compiler tools | ADHD-specific | Emerging; free web tool + $1.99 app, indie developer (Bram De Buyser) |
| **Todoist** | Clean task manager with filtering, labels, recurring tasks; positioned as ADHD-friendly | General | Mature; 5+ years, millions of users, Doist (parent company) well-funded |
| **Trello** | Visual Kanban-style board for project tracking | General | Mature; acquired by Atlassian (2017), feature-complete |
| **ClickUp** | Feature-rich PM platform; introduced ADHD productivity view in 2023 (increased retention 41%) | General (ADHD features added) | Mature; $537M+ raised, unicorn valuation |
| **Notion** | All-in-one workspace with ADHD-themed templates; "micro-tasking" sections for project breakdown | General (ADHD templates available) | Mature; $2.7B+ valuation |
| **Shimmer** | ADHD coaching platform with 1:1 accountability, weekly sessions, text check-ins | ADHD-specific (coaching, not PM tool) | Established; $3.5M raised (YC, Worklife Ventures), 1,200+ clients, 10K+ sessions |
| **Focusmate** | Body doubling for accountability during work sessions | General (strong ADHD use) | Established; ~$471K-921K raised |

### Q3: How mature are leading products? — Score: 3 (Established)

**Assessment:** The ADHD-specific project management space has clear emerging leaders (Leantime, Amazing Marvin) but no dominant player. Leantime is the only purpose-built ADHD PM tool and remains at seed-stage with modest funding ($140K non-dilutive). Amazing Marvin is beloved by its community but appears bootstrapped with no disclosed funding. The general PM space is fully mature (Notion, ClickUp, Asana — all at scale), but these tools do not address the specific delay-discounting mechanism. The overall maturity is "established" — products exist and are evolving, some have multi-year track records, but no clear market leader owns the ADHD long-term project management category.

**Evidence:**
- Leantime: Techstars '23 but still seeking seed funding, ~$140K non-dilutive, $36K revenue in 2023
- Amazing Marvin: multi-year operation, strong reviews (10/10 from ADHD users), but indie scale
- General PM tools (Notion $2.7B+, ClickUp $537M+) are mature but don't address the core problem
- Shimmer provides coaching accountability but is not a PM tool
- No ADHD-specific PM tool has achieved >$10M in funding or >100K paying users

### Q4: ADHD user review effectiveness? — Score: 4 (Mixed-negative)

**Assessment:** ADHD user sentiment on long-term project management tools is predominantly negative. The "productivity app graveyard" theme is pervasive — users describe a predictable cycle of enthusiastic setup followed by complete abandonment. Standard PM tools (Trello, Asana, Notion) receive consistent criticism for assuming that future milestones create present motivation — the exact assumption that delay discounting invalidates. Even ADHD-specific tools receive mixed reviews: Amazing Marvin is praised for customization but criticized for steep learning curve and mobile limitations; Leantime is respected for its ADHD-first design but is still early-stage with limited features. The core complaint is that no tool solves the fundamental motivational decay problem — "most productivity apps are just digital procrastination that give the illusion of control."

**Evidence:**
- Glassdoor community post: "I go all in for two weeks, build out gorgeous workflows, and then completely forget they exist... getting a dopamine hit from setting up the system, but not from actually using it"
- One respondent stated bluntly: "nothing is going to work for the long term" — their strategy was to rotate through 3-4 organization methods
- Medium author deleted 47 productivity apps in 30 days
- AFFiNE: "when an ADHDer sees [a to-do list], every item screams with equal urgency. A static to-do list quickly becomes a 'Wall of Shame'"
- Tiimo published "ADHD Project Graveyard" article documenting the phenomenon
- Amazing Marvin: praised (10/10 ADHD reviews) but learning curve noted as barrier; "almost noped out" initially
- Leantime: praised conceptually but early-stage product limitations
- Key complaint: tools help with task *management* but not with *motivational sustenance* over time

### Q5: Root cause of existing solution failures

**Primary failure pattern: Tools manage project structure but do not address the delay-discounting mechanism that causes ADHD users to systematically deprioritize long-term work.**

Specific root causes:

1. **Future milestones don't create present motivation.** Gantt charts, milestone trackers, and progress bars assume that seeing a distant deadline creates urgency. For ADHD brains with steep delay discounting, a deadline 3 months away has near-zero motivational weight. No existing tool translates distant rewards into immediate ones.

2. **Motivational decay is unaddressed.** The "project graveyard" phenomenon — enthusiastic start, gradual disengagement, complete abandonment — is described by virtually every ADHD user discussing long-term projects. Tools track task completion but don't detect or intervene when engagement is declining. Leantime's emoji sentiment tracking is the closest approach to this, but it requires manual self-report rather than detecting disengagement automatically.

3. **One-time setup, zero maintenance support.** ADHD users describe getting a dopamine hit from setting up elaborate project structures (a novelty/creation reward), then never returning to maintain them. Tools assume the user will regularly review and update their project plan — an assumption that fails when the project loses its novelty. No tool currently provides proactive re-engagement nudges calibrated to the individual's declining engagement pattern.

4. **No bridge between daily operations and strategic work.** ADHD users complete daily operational work effectively (it has immediate consequences) while strategic projects languish (distant consequences). The two operate in disconnected systems — daily tasks in one app, strategic projects in another. No tool effectively surfaces long-term project micro-tasks within the user's daily operational workflow at the right moment.

5. **Accountability gaps.** Shimmer and Focusmate provide human accountability, which ADHD users consistently describe as the most effective intervention. But these are session-based (15-50 minute blocks), not project-lifecycle-based. No tool provides persistent, adaptive accountability over the weeks/months of a long-term project.

**The gap:** No product addresses the delay-discounting mechanism directly. A tool that (a) automatically surfaces micro-tasks from long-term projects into daily workflows, (b) detects declining engagement and intervenes before full abandonment, (c) makes distant rewards feel immediate through gamification/reward proximity, and (d) provides persistent adaptive accountability throughout a project lifecycle would address a clear unmet need. This gap is more specific and defensible than the FP02 focus gap.

### FP08 Summary Scores

| Question | Score | Confidence |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Q1: Market noise | 3 (Moderate) | Moderate-High |
| Q3: Product maturity | 3 (Established) | Moderate |
| Q4: ADHD effectiveness | 4 (Mixed-negative) | High |
| **Market Gap Score** | **10/15** | |

**Interpretation:** This is a substantially more attractive market gap than FP02. Moderate noise (Q1=3), established but not dominant competitors (Q3=3), and high user dissatisfaction (Q4=4) create a meaningful opportunity. The specific mechanism (delay discounting / motivational decay) is well-understood but unaddressed by existing tools, providing a defensible differentiation angle. The primary risk is that Leantime, Amazing Marvin, or a well-funded general PM tool (ClickUp, Notion) could move into this space.

---

## FP04: Deadline Misses / Late Delivery

**Problem Score (from S3): 10/15**

### Q1: How noisy is the market? — Score: 2 (Noisy)

**Assessment:** Deadline management is a core function of virtually every productivity and project management tool on the market. Reminders, due dates, and countdown timers are table-stakes features in Todoist, TickTick, Asana, Monday.com, Notion, ClickUp, Google Calendar, Outlook, and dozens of others. The ADHD-specific deadline management subcategory is also well-populated with tools addressing time blindness (Tiimo, Structured, Due, Brili) and AI auto-scheduling (Motion, Reclaim.ai/Dropbox, Morgen, Akiflow). The market is noisy — not quite as saturated as the focus category (Q1=1 for FP02) because the deadline-specific tools are somewhat more differentiated, but still crowded.

**Evidence:**
- Every major PM and task management tool includes deadline/reminder features as standard
- AI scheduling alone has 4+ funded players: Motion ($13M raised), Reclaim.ai (acquired by Dropbox for $9.5M+ raised), Morgen, Akiflow ($2.3M raised)
- ADHD-specific time awareness tools: Tiimo ($5.99M raised), Structured, Due, Brili
- Persistent reminder apps (Due, auto-snooze feature) specifically target "reminder blindness"
- ADDitude Magazine lists 42 time-management apps and hacks for ADHD

### Q2: What products exist?

| Product | Description | ADHD-Specific? | Maturity |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Motion** | AI auto-scheduling; adds tasks with deadlines and priorities, AI schedules/reschedules across calendar in real-time; at-risk warnings days/weeks in advance | General (ADHD positioning) | Established; ~$13M raised, Fellows Fund investor, ranked #1 fastest-growing by Amplitude |
| **Reclaim.ai** (now Dropbox) | AI calendar that auto-schedules focus time, tasks, habits, breaks; reduces decision paralysis by picking next task | General (ADHD user adoption) | Mature; $9.5M raised, acquired by Dropbox Aug 2024, 65K+ companies |
| **Tiimo** | Visual daily planner with timeline view; makes time concrete through color-coded visual flow; AI task breakdown | ADHD-specific | Established; $5.99M raised, Apple App of the Year 2025 |
| **Akiflow** | Unified inbox + calendar with time blocking; consolidates tasks from multiple sources | General (strong ADHD reviews) | Emerging-Established; $2.3M raised (YC), $10M valuation, $200K ARR |
| **Due** | Persistent reminder app with auto-snooze; reminders repeat every 5 minutes until marked done | General (ADHD-popular) | Mature; $4.99 one-time, 5+ years in market |
| **Structured** | Visual day planner with drag-and-drop timeline; natural language parsing, automatic task adjustment when tasks run over | General (ADHD-friendly design) | Established; subscription model |
| **Morgen** | Unified calendar with Frame system (capacity visualization) and AI Planner; imports tasks from Notion, ClickUp, Todoist | General | Established; active development, multi-platform |
| **Sunsama** | Daily planner with planning ritual, time estimation, overcommitment warnings, end-of-day reflection | General (strong ADHD following) | Established; subscription model |
| **Brili** | Routine builder with timed steps; breaks tasks into smaller steps with time limits | ADHD-specific | Established; targets families and adults with ADHD |
| **Inflow** | CBT-based ADHD management with time perception skill-building modules | ADHD-specific (broader scope) | Established; $13.3M raised |
| **Todoist** | Task manager with due dates, priorities, recurring tasks, natural language input | General | Mature; millions of users |
| **TickTick** | All-in-one task manager with calendar, Pomodoro, habit tracking, reminders | General | Mature; multi-platform, 5+ years |

### Q3: How mature are leading products? — Score: 2 (Mature)

**Assessment:** The deadline management category is dominated by mature players. Motion ($13M raised, AI scheduling at scale), Reclaim.ai (acquired by Dropbox), and traditional tools (Todoist, TickTick, Google Calendar) have been iterating on deadline management for 5+ years. The AI auto-scheduling subcategory is particularly well-funded and moving fast — Motion, Reclaim.ai, Morgen, and Akiflow all offer sophisticated algorithms that automatically prioritize and schedule work around deadlines. The ADHD-specific time awareness tools (Tiimo, Structured) are established with meaningful user bases. This is a mature market with well-funded incumbents.

**Evidence:**
- Reclaim.ai: acquired by Dropbox (Aug 2024), $9.5M raised, 65K+ companies — category effectively consolidated under Dropbox
- Motion: $13M raised, AI scheduling at enterprise scale
- Tiimo: Apple App of the Year 2025, $5.99M raised
- Due: 5+ years in market with a specific, well-refined niche (persistent reminders)
- General tools (Todoist, TickTick, Google Calendar) have decades of refinement on deadline features

### Q4: ADHD user review effectiveness? — Score: 3 (Mixed)

**Assessment:** Unlike FP02 and FP08, ADHD user sentiment on deadline management tools is roughly balanced between positive and negative. Several products receive genuine praise: Motion users report that AI auto-scheduling "replaced my todo-list, calendar, and project management"; Sunsama is described as "second only to my meds" for one ADHD user; Tiimo's visual timeline approach is well-received for making time concrete; Due's persistent reminders specifically address "reminder blindness." However, significant frustrations remain: Motion's high price ($34/month) generates backlash (one user called it "100% a scam" and recommended Reclaim.ai instead); standard reminders are dismissed as insufficient because they address notification, not the upstream causes (time blindness, initiation failure); and users note that deadline tools help with the *awareness* of deadlines but not with the *ability to act on them*.

**Evidence:**
- Positive: Motion user — "invaluable tool, lifeline" for ADHD; Sunsama user — "second only to my meds"
- Positive: Due specifically solves "reminder blindness" — auto-snooze until task marked done
- Positive: Reclaim.ai described as "massive executive function aid" that "fights decision paralysis"
- Positive: Akiflow Trustpilot — "only app that has helped me effectively manage asks as someone with severe ADHD"
- Mixed: Motion long-term user — "hasn't been quite as amazing as I'd hoped... but still promising"
- Negative: Motion App Store — "People with ADHD, put this $300 into your emergency fund and use Reclaim.ai instead"
- Negative: Standard reminders don't address *why* deadlines are missed — time blindness and initiation failure are upstream causes
- Key insight: deadline tools that *automate scheduling and reduce decisions* (Motion, Reclaim.ai, Sunsama) are better reviewed than tools that merely *remind* (calendar alerts, to-do list due dates)

### Q5: Root cause of existing solution failures

**Primary failure pattern: Deadline tools address notification and scheduling but not the upstream causes (time blindness, initiation failure, focus instability) that make ADHD users miss deadlines.**

Specific root causes:

1. **Reminders notify but don't activate.** A reminder that a deadline is approaching doesn't help an ADHD user who knows the deadline exists but cannot initiate work on it. The gap between *awareness* and *action* is the core problem. Due's persistent reminders partially address reminder blindness, but even persistent reminders don't overcome initiation failure.

2. **Time estimation remains unsolved.** Even AI schedulers (Motion, Reclaim.ai) require users to input time estimates for tasks — but ADHD users consistently underestimate task duration. If the input is wrong, the AI schedule is wrong. No tool currently calibrates time estimates based on the user's historical actual-vs-estimated performance specifically for ADHD patterns.

3. **Cascading failure from upstream problems.** As scored in S3, FP04 is primarily a *receiving* problem — caused by FP03 (time blindness), FP01 (initiation failure), FP02 (focus instability), and FP05 (prioritization failure). Deadline tools that only address the deadline layer (scheduling, reminders) without addressing upstream causes provide partial benefit at best. The most effective tools (Sunsama's daily planning ritual, Motion's auto-rescheduling) succeed because they indirectly address some upstream causes — Sunsama forces daily prioritization (FP05), Motion removes scheduling decisions (reduces cognitive load).

4. **At-risk detection is reactive, not predictive.** Motion warns when a task is "at risk" of missing its deadline, but this warning comes when the problem is already materializing. No tool currently monitors work patterns (e.g., declining engagement with a project, increasing focus failures on work days) and predicts deadline risk before it becomes critical.

5. **AI scheduling assumes rational task execution.** Motion and Reclaim.ai optimize schedules based on priorities, deadlines, and available time. They assume that once a task is scheduled, it will be executed. For ADHD users, being scheduled to work on something at 2pm does not mean they will start at 2pm (initiation failure), focus effectively during the block (attention variability), or complete the expected amount (time blindness). AI scheduling solves the planning problem but not the execution problem.

**The gap:** The specific gap is narrow because AI scheduling tools (Motion, Reclaim.ai) address a meaningful portion of the deadline problem, and tools like Sunsama address the daily planning ritual. The remaining gap is in the connection between scheduling and execution — detecting when planned work isn't happening and intervening in real-time, calibrating time estimates based on ADHD-specific patterns, and addressing the upstream causes (initiation, focus) within the deadline management workflow. This is a harder gap to fill because it requires solving multiple upstream problems simultaneously.

### FP04 Summary Scores

| Question | Score | Confidence |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Q1: Market noise | 2 (Noisy) | High |
| Q3: Product maturity | 2 (Mature) | High |
| Q4: ADHD effectiveness | 3 (Mixed) | Moderate-High |
| **Market Gap Score** | **7/15** | |

**Interpretation:** FP04 has the least attractive market gap of the three problems analyzed. Noisy market (Q1=2), mature products (Q3=2), and only moderately negative user sentiment (Q4=3) leave limited room for a new entrant. The AI scheduling category (Motion, Reclaim.ai/Dropbox) is well-funded and improving rapidly. The remaining gap — connecting scheduling to execution and addressing upstream causes — is real but requires solving multiple harder problems (FP01, FP02, FP03) to fully address. FP04 is likely better served as a downstream benefit of solving higher-gap upstream problems rather than as a direct product target.

## Notable Uncertainties

1. **Funding data inconsistencies.** Crunchbase, Tracxn, PitchBook, and CB Insights frequently report different funding totals for the same company (e.g., Focusmate: $471K to $921K depending on source). Where discrepancies exist, ranges are provided.

2. **ADHD-specific vs. general adoption.** Many general-purpose tools (Forest, Todoist, Sunsama) have strong ADHD user communities, but user demographic breakdowns are not publicly available. Claims about "ADHD adoption" are inferred from community sentiment, not verified user data.

3. **Revenue and retention data.** Most ADHD-specific startups (Leantime, Amazing Marvin, Numo, Saner.AI) do not disclose revenue or retention metrics. Market maturity assessments rely on proxy indicators (funding, user counts, review volume).

4. **Reddit sentiment limitations.** Direct Reddit threads were not accessible through web search in several queries. ADHD community sentiment is reconstructed from secondary sources that aggregate Reddit discussions rather than direct thread analysis.

5. **Delay discounting tool gap.** No product was found that specifically targets the delay-discounting mechanism with evidence-based interventions (e.g., episodic future thinking, reward proximity manipulation). This gap is documented in the clinical literature (Solanto 2011 CBT program, behavioral training reviews) but has not been translated into software. This could represent either a genuine greenfield opportunity or an indication that the mechanism is difficult to productize.

6. **AI scheduling category velocity.** Motion and Reclaim.ai/Dropbox are improving rapidly. The FP04 gap analysis may become outdated quickly as AI scheduling capabilities advance. Dropbox's acquisition of Reclaim.ai (Aug 2024) signals category consolidation that could accelerate feature development.
