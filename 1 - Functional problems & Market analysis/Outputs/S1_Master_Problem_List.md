# S1: Master Problem List — ADHD Workplace Functional Problems

## Methodology Note

This list was compiled by extracting every distinct functional problem mentioned across all six Phase 1–2 research files (P1A, P1B, P1C, P2A, P2B, P2C), then deduplicating. Per the methodology, functional problems are defined as **observable failures to complete, maintain, or perform a work-relevant task or behaviour** — not symptoms or internal experiences.

Where research sources used symptom language (e.g., "difficulty with sustained attention"), the problem was translated into functional terms and flagged. Where multiple source files described the same failure from different angles, they were merged into a single entry with all sources noted.

Evidence tiers follow the methodology:
- **Tier 1**: Peer-reviewed research, government/NHS data, systematic reviews
- **Tier 2**: Industry reports, large-scale surveys (n>500), expert opinion, user reviews/forum synthesis
- **Tier 3**: Smaller surveys, multiple consistent anecdotal sources
- **Tier 4**: Single studies, individual anecdotes, extrapolation from adjacent domains

## Problem List

### FP01: Task Initiation Failure

- **Functional definition:** Fails to begin known-important work tasks despite understanding what needs to be done. Experiences extended delays between intending to start and actually starting, resulting in missed or compressed deadlines.
- **Source files:** P1A (§3 — difficulty taking on new tasks, 40.7% prevalence), P1C (§ procrastination), P2A (§1 — #1 most discussed, 303+ upvotes), P2B (§ assumption of existing discipline), P2C (§ procrastination and task initiation)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 1 (WFIRS data, P1A) + Tier 2–3 (user/practitioner reports)
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - 40.7% of ADHD adults report "problems taking on new tasks" often/very often vs 9.7% controls (WFIRS, n=134) [P1A]
  - #1 most-discussed work problem across ADHD communities [P2A]
  - Described as qualitatively different from procrastination — "invisible barrier" despite full knowledge and planning [P2A]
- **Symptom-to-function translation?** Partially — clinical sources describe "difficulty with task initiation" (executive function term); translated to the observable failure of not beginning work. Confidence: High — the functional framing is well-supported.

---

### FP02: Inconsistent Focus and Sustained Attention Failure

- **Functional definition:** Fails to maintain productive output for expected durations. Work that should take minutes extends to hours. Productive capacity varies dramatically day-to-day with no reliable pattern, resulting in unpredictable output.
- **Source files:** P1A (§1 — inefficient task completion, 55% prevalence; §6 — presenteeism), P1C (§ efficiency and task completion problems), P2A (§2 — 29% ADDitude poll, #2 most discussed), P2C (§ emotional dysregulation → performance decline cycle)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 1 (WFIRS, WHO data)
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - 55% of ADHD adults report "problems getting work done efficiently" often/very often vs 11.7% controls (WFIRS) [P1A]
  - 29.27% of ~1,000 ADDitude respondents cited "focusing consistently" as top work challenge [P2A]
  - 21.7 days/year of reduced work quantity, 13.6 days/year of reduced work quality (WHO, 10-country survey, n=7,075) [P1A]
  - 22.1 extra days/year of lost role performance vs workers without ADHD [P1A]
- **Symptom-to-function translation?** Yes — "difficulty with sustained attention" (DSM symptom) translated to observable output failures. Confidence: High.
- **Key citations:**

---

### FP03: Time Estimation Errors and Time Blindness

- **Functional definition:** Consistently misjudges how long tasks will take, leading to overcommitted schedules, missed deadlines, and unreliable time promises to colleagues and clients. Loses awareness of time passage during work.
- **Source files:** P1A (§4 — tardiness, 27.8%), P1C (§ time management failures, mediating EF deficit), P2A (§4 — time blindness, lost 3 jobs), P2C (§ time management — foundational, prioritized first by practitioners)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 1 (mediation analysis, WFIRS) + Tier 2–3 (user reports, practitioner consensus)
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - Self-management to time identified as most significant EF deficit mediating ADHD → job burnout link (2024 study) [P1C]

  - Fuermaier et al. (2021), WFIRS — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8295111/

---

### FP04: Deadline Misses and Late Delivery

- **Functional definition:** Submits work products after agreed deadlines. Requires deadline extensions or produces rushed, lower-quality output at the last minute. Creates downstream delays for dependent colleagues.
- **Source files:** P1A (§6 — presenteeism/missed deadlines), P1C (§ termination triggers — #1 cited reason), P2A (§ most career-damaging — top termination reason), P2C (§ overwhelm-burnout cycle step 1)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 1 (employer ratings, epidemiological data)
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - Employer ratings show significantly more impairment in "meeting deadlines" for ADHD vs controls [P1A, Barkley 2010]
  - Most frequently cited termination reason across user threads [P2A]
  - 21.7 days/year of reduced work quantity (WHO) — includes deadline-related failures [P1A]
- **Symptom-to-function translation?** No — already functional.

---

### FP05: Prioritisation Failure

- **Functional definition:** Spends time on low-value activities while high-priority tasks are neglected. Cannot effectively sequence multiple competing demands. When faced with several tasks of similar urgency, either freezes or switches rapidly without completing any.
- **Source files:** P1A (§1 — difficulty prioritising as part of inefficient task completion), P2A (§3 — 21.86% ADDitude poll), P2C (§ organization, planning, and prioritisation)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 1 (WFIRS component) + Tier 2 (ADDitude poll, n≈1,000)
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - 21.86% of ~1,000 ADDitude respondents cited "determining and working toward priorities" as top challenge [P2A]
  - Included in the 55% who report "problems getting work done efficiently" (WFIRS) — prioritisation is a named sub-component [P1A]
  - Practitioners identify this alongside time management and organisation as core presenting problems [P2C]
- **Symptom-to-function translation?** Partial — "executive dysfunction in planning" translated to observable prioritisation failure. Confidence: High.
- **Key citations:**
  - ADDitude poll (~1,000 respondents) via P2A
  - Fuermaier et al. (2021) — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8295111/

---

### FP06: Attention-to-Detail Errors

- **Functional definition:** Produces work containing errors of oversight — typos, incorrect figures, missed steps, incomplete submissions — despite checking. Requires excessive QA from self or others before work meets quality standards.
- **Source files:** P1A (§1 — errors/omissions requiring rework), P1C (§ careless mistakes — DSM criterion, termination trigger), P2A (§5 — terminated from 4 jobs in 2.5 years for detail errors)

- **Key citations:**
  - DSM-5 criterion via P1C — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7287898/
  - Fuermaier et al. (2021) — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8295111/

- **Source files:** P2A (§6 — "understanding everything—walking out and not 'remembering' anything"), P1C (§ forgetting tasks/responsibilities), P2C (§ forgetting instructions, names, and commitments)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 2–3 (user reports, practitioner observations) — limited specific clinical research on this manifestation
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - High engagement on Reddit threads describing this failure [P2A]
  - Working memory deficit prevalence: ~60% impairment reported (figure from P2A, source needs verification)
  - Practitioners list "forgetting instructions, names, and commitments" as common presenting problem [P2C]
- **Symptom-to-function translation?** Yes — "working memory deficit" (neuropsychological term) translated to the functional failure of not retaining meeting content. Confidence: Moderate — the specific meeting-memory manifestation has limited targeted research.
- **Key citations:**
  - User reports via P2A
  - Practitioner consensus (UK ADHD Network) via P2C — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7863422/

---

### FP08: Long-Term Project Neglect

- **Key citations:**
  - Fuermaier et al. (2021) — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8295111/
  - User reports via P2A

---

### FP09: Email and Communication Management Failure

- **Source files:** P2A (§8 — email management overwhelm), P2B (§ Google Calendar/Tasks — forgetting to check), P1B (§ TTS software — difficulty processing text-heavy materials)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 3 (user community reports, practitioner observations)
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - Working memory impairment cited as underlying cause (~60% impairment rate, source verification needed) [P2A]
  - Users report avoidance behaviours, paralysis facing 100+ unread emails [P2A]
  - User terminated specifically for "failing to send a calendar invite" [P2A]
- **Symptom-to-function translation?** No — already functional.
- **Key citations:**
  - User reports via P2A
  - Working memory research via P1C — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5729117/

---

### FP10: Context Switching Cost

- **Source files:** P2A (§9 — "2-3 hours of my day is spent just staring at something and figuring out where I was"), P2C (§ time management — struggling with transitions between tasks)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 3–4 (user reports, single estimates; limited clinical quantification)
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - One user estimates 2-3 hours/day lost to reorientation after interruptions [P2A — Tier 4, single report]
  - Programmers describe 30-minute recovery after meetings [P2A]
  - Practitioners identify task transitions as a key time management difficulty [P2C]
- **Symptom-to-function translation?** No — already functional.
- **Key citations:**
  - User reports via P2A

---

### FP11: Documentation and Administrative Paralysis

- **Functional definition:** Fails to complete required paperwork, reports, documentation, and administrative tasks. These tasks are chronically delayed or avoided despite understanding their importance and having the skills to complete them.
- **Source files:** P2A (§10 — "paperwork is hell"), P1A (§3 — avoidance of tasks requiring planning)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 3 (user reports, limited clinical quantification of this specific manifestation)
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - Occupational therapist with ADHD describes paralysis completing evaluations despite financial consequences [P2A]
  - Users describe documentation as uniquely aversive — "Nothing makes it NOT paperwork" [P2A]
- **Symptom-to-function translation?** No — already functional.
- **Key citations:**
  - User reports via P2A

---

### FP12: Chronic Lateness to Work and Meetings

- **Functional definition:** Arrives late to work, meetings, appointments, and shift starts despite awareness of the problem and repeated consequences. Pattern persists even with alarms, reminders, and penalties.
- **Source files:** P1A (§4 — 27.8% prevalence), P1C (§ attendance and reliability issues), P2C (§ time management — chronic lateness)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 1 (WFIRS data, employer ratings)
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - 27.8% of ADHD adults report "problems with being late" often/very often vs 7.8% controls [P1A]
  - Employers rate significantly more impairment in punctuality for ADHD vs controls [P1A, Barkley 2010]
  - 28% lateness rate per P1C
- **Symptom-to-function translation?** No — already functional.
- **Key citations:**
  - Fuermaier et al. (2021) — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8295111/
  - Barkley & Murphy (2010) — https://academic.oup.com/acn/article/25/3/157/3840

**Note:** FP12 is closely related to FP03 (time blindness) — time estimation errors are the primary cause of chronic lateness. They are kept separate because the functional failure is distinct: FP03 is about misjudging task duration; FP12 is about arriving late to scheduled commitments. Both may be addressed by the same solution.

---

### FP13: Attendance and Sickness Absence

- **Functional definition:** Misses work days at a rate significantly exceeding peers. Includes unplanned absences, extended sick leave, and difficulty maintaining reliable presence, particularly under stress.

- **Key citations:**
  - Bjerrum et al. (qualitative study) — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714234/
  - CHADD — https://chadd.org/adhd-news/adhd-news-adults/attention-manage-those-big-adhd-emotions-at-work/

---

### FP17: Impulsive Job Quitting

- **Functional definition:** Quits jobs suddenly in response to boredom, conflict, or minor setbacks without having alternative employment secured. Creates fragmented career history and financial instability.
- **Source files:** P1A (§8 — impulsive quitting, frequent job changes), P1C (§ impulsive decision-making — 3x more likely to quit impulsively)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 1 (structured occupational interviews, longitudinal data)
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - 3x more likely to quit a job impulsively vs adults without ADHD [P1C]
  - Higher percentage of jobs quit due to boredom or hostility with employer [P1A, Barkley 2010]
  - More frequent job changes than non-ADHD clinic referrals [P1A, Murphy & Barkley 1996]

- **Key citations:**
  - Barkley & Murphy (2010) — https://academic.oup.com/acn/article/25/3/157/3840
  - Murphy & Barkley (1996) — https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8932963/

---

### FP18: Workspace Disorganisation

- **Functional definition:** Maintains a cluttered, disorganised physical and/or digital workspace that impedes finding documents, tools, and information when needed. Loses important items. Fails to maintain filing or organisation systems after initial setup.

- **Key citations:**
  - Sáez-Suanes & Álvarez-Montero (2024) — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11007411/
  - UK ADHD Network consensus — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7863422/

---

### FP19: Safety Errors and Workplace Accidents

- **Functional definition:** Commits errors related to safety procedures, checklists, or equipment operation. At higher risk of workplace injuries and traffic accidents than peers.
- **Source files:** P1A (§12 — increased accident risk, 2x+ risk), P1C (§ safety concerns)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 1 (epidemiological data, emergency department studies)
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - 2x+ risk of sickness absence and workplace accidents (WHO survey) [P1A]
  - Double the odds of severe-injury category (2024 ED study) [P1A]
  - 23% higher risk of road traffic accidents, ~52,000 extra accidents/year in US [P1A]
  - $2.1B in excess non-medical accident-related costs [P1A]

- **Key citations:**
  - de Graaf et al. (2008) — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2665789/
  - Schein et al. — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12128943/

---

### FP20: Underperforming Relative to Capability

- **Functional definition:** Consistently delivers work below the level expected given training, intelligence, and demonstrated capability. Fails to progress in career, take on higher-level responsibilities, or contribute at a level matching credentials.
- **Source files:** P1A (§2 — 69.2% prevalence, #1 WFIRS item), P1C (§ discrepancy between internal experience and external evaluation)
- **Evidence tier:** Tier 1 (WFIRS — most commonly endorsed work problem)
- **Key quantitative data:**
  - 69.2% of ADHD adults vs 16.6% controls report "problems working to your potential" often/very often — single most endorsed WFIRS work item [P1A]
  - More common than being fired, attendance problems, or poor evaluations [P1A]
  - Employer ratings confirm lower overall work performance even when employment rates similar [P1A]
- **Symptom-to-function translation?** No — already functional.
- **Key citations:**
  - Fuermaier et al. (2021) — https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8295111/

**Note:** FP20 is a meta-outcome — the cumulative result of multiple other functional problems (FP01–FP11 especially). It is retained as a standalone problem because (a) it is the single most commonly endorsed WFIRS item, (b) users experience it as a distinct source of distress, and (c) it may be directly addressable through interventions that increase output relative to capability. However, scoring should account for its composite nature.

## Deduplication Decisions

The following merges were made during deduplication:

1. **P1A §1 (inefficient task completion) + P2A §2 (inconsistent focus) + P1C (productivity/efficiency)** → Merged into **FP02** (Inconsistent Focus). These describe the same functional failure from clinical, user, and economic perspectives.

2. **P1A §4 (tardiness) vs P1A §5 (attendance)** → Kept separate as **FP12** (Chronic Lateness) and **FP13** (Attendance). Lateness is about arriving late; attendance is about not arriving at all. Different consequences and different addressability profiles.

3. **P1A §7 (job instability) + P1A §8 (impulsive quitting)** → Split. FP17 captures the impulsive quitting behaviour. Job instability (§7) is treated as an outcome of multiple problems rather than a standalone functional problem.

4. **P1A §9 (supervisor conflicts) + P1A §10 (team problems)** → Kept separate as **FP14** and **FP15**. They have different WFIRS prevalences (26.3% vs 30.8%) and different addressability profiles — supervisor conflicts involve authority dynamics while team failures involve coordination.

5. **P1A §13 (labour-market marginalisation)** → Not included as a standalone functional problem. This is a long-term outcome, not an observable daily work failure. It is the cumulative consequence of FP01–FP19.

6. **P1A §11 (poor performance evaluations)** → Not listed separately. This is an outcome triggered by FP02, FP04, FP06, and others rather than a distinct functional failure.

7. **P2B tool failure patterns** → Not listed as problems themselves. They inform market gap analysis (Step 6) and solution design constraints. The five patterns (setup hyperfocus trap, out-of-sight-out-of-mind, shame spiral, assumption of discipline, maintenance burden) are design constraints, not functional problems.
