# S3: Problem Layer Scoring

## Methodology Note

Each problem that passed both gates in S2 is scored on three dimensions from the methodology:

**Q1: Frequency of Disruption** (1–5)
- 5 = Multiple times per day
- 4 = Daily
- 3 = Several times per week
- 2 = Weekly
- 1 = Monthly or less

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation** (1–5)
How different is the ADHD experience of this problem from the neurotypical experience? Higher = more differentiated = stronger case for ADHD-specific design.
- 5 = Highly differentiated: qualitatively different triggers, patterns, or failure modes requiring specific design
- 4 = Substantially differentiated: same problem but significantly more severe/frequent; standard solutions often fail
- 3 = Moderately differentiated: common problem with ADHD-specific aspects affecting which solutions work
- 2 = Slightly differentiated: general problem, ADHD adds some nuance but standard solutions mostly work
- 1 = Not differentiated: ADHD users experience this the same way as everyone

**Q3: Connectedness** (1–5)
Does addressing this problem meaningfully reduce other functional problems?
- 5 = Hub problem: addressing this would meaningfully reduce 4+ other identified problems
- 4 = Cluster centre: would meaningfully reduce 2–3 other problems
- 3 = Connected: would meaningfully reduce 1 other problem
- 2 = Loosely related: shares context but addressing it wouldn't directly reduce others
- 1 = Isolated: standalone problem

Evidence tier is noted for each score. Higher-tier evidence increases scoring confidence.

## Detailed Scoring

### FP03: Time Estimation Errors / Time Blindness — Total: 14/15

**Q1: Frequency — 4 (Daily)**
- Assessment: Time estimation is required whenever planning tasks, making commitments, or scheduling work — functionally a daily event for knowledge workers. However, the *failure* doesn't manifest every single instance; rather, it shows up daily as a background distortion affecting all planning. Users describe losing awareness of time passage "every day" during work.
- Evidence: 27.8% report lateness problems often/very often [P1A, Tier 1]. Users describe daily time-awareness failures [P2A, Tier 3]. Practitioners identify it as "consistently the most frequently reported workplace challenge" [P2C, Tier 2].
- Evidence tier: 1

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 5 (Highly differentiated)**
- Assessment: Time blindness is neurologically distinct in ADHD. Research describes it as a fundamental difference in time perception, not merely poor planning. P2C explicitly states "time blindness is a neurological difference in how the brain perceives and tracks time, not a character flaw." Neurotypical workers misjudge time occasionally; ADHD adults experience a persistent, qualitative inability to perceive time passage that renders standard time-management advice ineffective. P2B documents that tools designed for neurotypical time estimation (calendars, to-do lists) consistently fail for ADHD users because they assume an internal time sense that doesn't exist.
- Evidence: Neurological basis documented [P2C, Tier 1–2]. Self-management to time identified as primary EF mediating deficit [P1C, Tier 1]. Standard tools fail specifically because they assume existing time awareness [P2B, Tier 3].
- Evidence tier: 1

**Q3: Connectedness — 5 (Hub problem)**
- Assessment: Time blindness is the most connected problem in the set. Addressing it would meaningfully reduce:
  1. **FP04 Deadline misses** — deadlines are missed primarily because of time estimation errors
  2. **FP12 Chronic lateness** — lateness is a direct manifestation of time blindness
  3. **FP08 Long-term project neglect** — delay discounting is a time-perception failure; improving time awareness could partially address the "distant deadline" problem
  4. **FP05 Prioritisation failure** — inability to estimate task duration prevents effective sequencing
  5. **FP02 Inconsistent focus** — losing track of time passage contributes to extended unproductive periods going unnoticed
- P2C explicitly identifies time management as foundational "because these executive function deficits create cascading effects on other work performance areas." The overwhelm-burnout cycle begins with time management difficulties.
- Evidence: P2C cascading-effects model [Tier 2]. EF mediation analysis [P1C, Tier 1]. User narratives of chain reactions [P2A, Tier 3].
- Evidence tier: 1–2

---

### FP01: Task Initiation Failure — Total: 14/15

**Q1: Frequency — 5 (Multiple times per day)**
- Assessment: Task initiation is required every time a new task must be started — which for knowledge workers occurs many times daily. Users describe the "invisible barrier" as present "every time I need to switch to a new task" and report multiple daily instances of paralysis. The 303+ upvote Reddit thread describes it as a constant workplace presence.
- Evidence: #1 most-discussed problem in ADHD communities — extremely high frequency implied by volume of discussion [P2A, Tier 3]. 40.7% report "problems taking on new tasks" often/very often [P1A, Tier 1]. Practitioners describe it as "one of the most pervasive challenges" [P2C, Tier 2].
- Evidence tier: 1

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 5 (Highly differentiated)**
- Assessment: Users explicitly describe this as "fundamentally different from procrastination." The "invisible barrier" metaphor — knowing exactly what to do but being physically unable to start — is qualitatively distinct from neurotypical reluctance. Neurotypical workers may delay tasks due to preference or avoidance, but can typically force themselves to start with effort. ADHD task initiation failure involves a neurological gate that effort alone cannot open. P2C attributes it to "altered rewards-processing systems" and "weaker executive functions," indicating a biological mechanism absent in neurotypical experience. Standard advice ("just start") fails because it assumes a functioning initiation system.
- Evidence: Qualitatively different from procrastination — "invisible barrier" [P2A, Tier 3]. Altered reward processing as mechanism [P2C, Tier 1–2]. Standard productivity advice fails specifically for this reason [P2B, Tier 3].
- Evidence tier: 2

**Q3: Connectedness — 4 (Cluster centre)**
- Assessment: Task initiation failure drives:
  1. **FP04 Deadline misses** — can't start = can't finish on time
  2. **FP08 Long-term project neglect** — strategic work is avoided because initiation barrier is higher for low-urgency tasks
  3. **FP11 Documentation paralysis** — documentation is particularly aversive to initiate (low stimulation, high effort)
- It does not directly cause FP03 (time blindness), FP12 (lateness), or FP06 (detail errors), distinguishing it from the FP03 hub. It is a cluster centre for 3 problems, not a 5-problem hub.
- Evidence: User narratives describe initiation as gateway to project neglect and documentation avoidance [P2A, Tier 3]. P2C identifies initiation as connected to multiple downstream failures [Tier 2].
- Evidence tier: 2

---

### FP05: Prioritisation Failure — Total: 13/15

**Q1: Frequency — 5 (Multiple times per day)**
- Assessment: Knowledge workers face prioritisation decisions throughout the day — which email to answer first, which task to tackle next, whether to respond to an interruption or stay on current work. ADHD adults face these decisions more frequently because they lose track of priorities after each interruption. The ADDitude poll finding (21.86% cite it as their #1 challenge) combined with users describing "too many competing important things" daily confirms high frequency.
- Evidence: 21.86% of ~1,000 respondents cite as top challenge [P2A, Tier 2]. Included in 55% reporting inefficient work [P1A, Tier 1]. Users describe daily paralysis from competing demands [P2A, Tier 3].
- Evidence tier: 1–2

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 4 (Substantially differentiated)**
- Assessment: Prioritisation difficulty is a common general problem, but ADHD creates a substantially more severe version. The key differentiator is that ADHD brains cannot reliably use importance/urgency as prioritisation criteria — they respond to interest, novelty, and immediate consequences instead. P2B documents that tools offering "more options" make the problem worse for ADHD users, while neurotypical users benefit from more information. Standard prioritisation frameworks (Eisenhower matrix, etc.) assume an ability to override preference with importance that ADHD fundamentally impairs. Score is 4 not 5 because the observable failure (doing the wrong task) looks similar even if the mechanism differs.
- Evidence: Interest-based rather than importance-based activation [P2C, Tier 2]. Standard frameworks fail [P2B, Tier 3]. Same problem but significantly more severe — "standard solutions often fail" fits score 4 definition.
- Evidence tier: 2

**Q3: Connectedness — 4 (Cluster centre)**
- Assessment: Prioritisation failure drives:
  1. **FP08 Long-term project neglect** — strategic work is deprioritised in favour of urgent daily tasks (procrastivity)
  2. **FP04 Deadline misses** — working on wrong tasks means right tasks don't get done
  3. **FP02 Inconsistent focus** — time spent on low-value activities is a form of focus misdirection
- Connected but not a hub because it doesn't directly cause FP03 (time blindness), FP12 (lateness), or FP06 (detail errors).
- Evidence: P2C "procrastivity" — tackling easier tasks while avoiding priorities [Tier 2]. P2A describes paralysis from competing demands leading to "nothing gets done" [Tier 3].
- Evidence tier: 2

---

### FP02: Inconsistent Focus / Sustained Attention Failure — Total: 13/15

**Q1: Frequency — 5 (Multiple times per day)**
- Assessment: Focus failures occur throughout each working day. Users describe "literally getting almost no work done during the day" with only "30 mins" of genuine focus. The WHO data showing 21.7 days/year of reduced quantity and 13.6 days of reduced quality implies that on affected days, the failure occurs repeatedly throughout the day. The 55% who report "problems getting work done efficiently" often/very often confirms this is a persistent daily experience, not an occasional lapse.
- Evidence: 55% often/very often (WFIRS) [P1A, Tier 1]. 21.7 reduced-quantity days/year (WHO, n=7,075) [P1A, Tier 1]. "Tasks that take others 5 min take me 30" [P2A, Tier 3]. 29.27% cite as #1 challenge (ADDitude, n≈1,000) [P2A, Tier 2].
- Evidence tier: 1

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 4 (Substantially differentiated)**
- Assessment: Everyone experiences focus lapses, but the ADHD version is substantially more severe and frequent, with qualitatively different patterns. The key differentiator is the *variability* — ADHD workers don't have uniformly poor focus; they have unpredictable oscillation between near-zero productivity and hyperfocus. P2A notes "different approaches seem to work on different days," making reliable workflow impossible. Standard solutions (Pomodoro, focus apps) fail because they assume consistent baseline attention. Score is 4 not 5 because the observable output failure (low productivity) looks similar in kind to neurotypical distraction, even though the severity and variability are substantially different.
- Evidence: Day-to-day variability as key differentiator [P2A, Tier 3]. Standard tools fail due to variable response [P2B, Tier 3]. 55% vs 11.7% prevalence — the 5x gap confirms substantial severity difference [P1A, Tier 1].
- Evidence tier: 1

**Q3: Connectedness — 4 (Cluster centre)**
- Assessment: Focus failure drives:
  1. **FP04 Deadline misses** — low-productivity days accumulate into insufficient output for deadlines
  2. **FP06 Detail errors** — attention lapses during task execution produce errors
  3. **FP08 Long-term project neglect** — inability to sustain attention on unstimulating strategic work
- Not scored as 5 because focus failure is often downstream of FP03 (time blindness — not noticing how much time has passed without progress) and FP05 (prioritisation — focusing on wrong things). It both causes and is caused by other problems, but its causal influence outward affects 3 problems.
- Evidence: P1A multi-domain impairment — inattention central to most impairments [Tier 1]. P2C overwhelm-burnout cycle includes focus decline as step 3–4 [Tier 2].
- Evidence tier: 1

---

### FP08: Long-Term Project Neglect — Total: 12/15

**Q1: Frequency — 4 (Daily)**
- Assessment: The avoidance of long-term projects is a daily pattern — each day the worker chooses immediate tasks over strategic work. The failure doesn't manifest as a single event but as a daily accumulation of avoidance. Users describe completing daily operational work every day while strategic projects remain untouched for weeks or months.
- Evidence: Users describe daily pattern of doing immediate tasks while avoiding long-term work [P2A, Tier 3]. 69.2% report "working below potential" (WFIRS) — many instances likely reflect this pattern [P1A, Tier 1].
- Evidence tier: 2 (frequency of avoidance pattern from user reports)

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 5 (Highly differentiated)**
- Assessment: This problem is driven by delay discounting — a neurological bias where distant rewards are drastically undervalued relative to immediate ones. This is a well-documented, neurologically-grounded ADHD phenomenon that is qualitatively different from general procrastination. Neurotypical workers can motivate themselves toward distant goals using importance and long-term thinking; ADHD brains literally discount the value of distant outcomes more steeply. P2A cites ADDitude explaining that ADHD brains are "inherently unable to anticipate and plan for the future" with a "very short 'time horizon'." This makes standard project management tools (Gantt charts, milestone trackers) ineffective because they assume future milestones create present motivation.
- Evidence: Delay discounting as ADHD-specific mechanism [P2A, Tier 1 — based on Barkley's research]. "Inherently unable to anticipate" — qualitatively different from neurotypical experience [P2A, Tier 2]. User terminated specifically for this pattern [P2A, Tier 3].
- Evidence tier: 1–2

**Q3: Connectedness — 3 (Connected)**
- Assessment: Long-term project neglect primarily connects to:
  1. **FP04 Deadline misses** — neglected projects eventually hit deadlines, creating crisis
- It is more a *consequence* of FP03 (time blindness), FP01 (initiation failure), and FP05 (prioritisation) than a *cause* of other problems. Solving project neglect wouldn't meaningfully reduce focus problems, time blindness, or detail errors. It connects strongly to one downstream outcome (deadline crises) but is otherwise a receiving problem, not a broadcasting one.
- Evidence: P2C overwhelm cycle — project neglect leads to deadline crises [Tier 2]. But causal arrows primarily point *toward* this problem from FP01, FP03, FP05 [Tier 2].
- Evidence tier: 2

---

### FP04: Deadline Misses / Late Delivery — Total: 10/15

**Q1: Frequency — 4 (Daily)**
- Assessment: Most knowledge workers have multiple active deadlines, so the *risk* of deadline failure is daily. The actual *miss* rate is lower than daily, but the daily experience of being behind schedule and at risk of missing deadlines is confirmed by WHO data (21.7 reduced-quantity days/year ≈ once per working week on average, with daily pressure on active deadlines).
- Evidence: 21.7 days/year reduced work quantity [P1A, Tier 1]. #1 termination reason [P2A, Tier 3]. Employer ratings show significant impairment in meeting deadlines [P1A, Tier 1].
- Evidence tier: 1

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 3 (Moderately differentiated)**
- Assessment: Deadline misses are a common general problem — many workers miss deadlines occasionally. The ADHD version is more frequent and severe (55% report efficiency problems vs 11.7% controls), but the observable failure looks similar. The differentiation lies in the *causes* (time blindness, initiation failure, focus problems) rather than the failure itself. Standard deadline management (reminders, project tracking) provides partial benefit to ADHD users — it doesn't completely fail the way it does for initiation or time estimation. Score is 3 because ADHD-specific aspects affect which solutions work, but the problem is recognisable and partially addressable with general tools.
- Evidence: 55% vs 11.7% prevalence gap confirms more severe but same kind of problem [P1A, Tier 1]. Standard deadline tools provide partial benefit [P2B, Tier 3].
- Evidence tier: 1

**Q3: Connectedness — 3 (Connected)**
- Assessment: Deadline misses are primarily a *receiving* problem — caused by FP01 (initiation), FP02 (focus), FP03 (time blindness), FP05 (prioritisation), and FP08 (project neglect). Addressing deadline misses directly (better tracking, alerts) would not reduce those upstream causes. The downstream consequence of deadline misses is:
  1. **Poor performance evaluations / termination risk** — but this was excluded as an outcome in S1
- Deadline misses connect to career consequences but don't cause other functional problems on the master list. Score 3 rather than 2 because persistent deadline failures feed into the overwhelm-burnout cycle (FP02 worsens as stress accumulates).
- Evidence: P2C overwhelm-burnout cycle [Tier 2]. Primarily a receiving problem [analysis].
- Evidence tier: 1

---

### FP06: Attention-to-Detail Errors — Total: 10/15

**Q1: Frequency — 4 (Daily)**
- Assessment: Detail errors occur regularly throughout work. Users describe errors persisting "even after checking my work 2 or 3x." Programmers report daily issues with forgetting files, leaving debug code, making minor coding errors. DSM-5 diagnostic criterion uses "often" frequency. 22.5% report poor performance evaluations driven by error patterns [P1A]. The 55% reporting inefficient work includes error-driven rework.
- Evidence: DSM-5 "often" criterion [Tier 1]. 22.5% poor evaluations [P1A, Tier 1]. Daily occurrence in user reports [P2A, Tier 3].
- Evidence tier: 1

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 3 (Moderately differentiated)**
- Assessment: Everyone makes mistakes. The ADHD version is more frequent and resistant to self-checking, but the errors themselves look identical. The differentiation is in severity (persisting after multiple checks) and the inability of standard QA processes to compensate. However, automated checking tools (spell-check, linters, validators) work equally well for ADHD and neurotypical users. The problem is moderately differentiated because ADHD users need more aggressive automated checking, but the tools themselves don't need fundamentally different design.
- Evidence: DSM criterion confirms higher prevalence [Tier 1]. Errors persist after checking — more severe than neurotypical [P2A, Tier 3]. But standard error-detection tools work for both populations — differentiation is in severity, not kind.
- Evidence tier: 1

**Q3: Connectedness — 3 (Connected)**
- Assessment: Detail errors primarily connect to:
  1. **FP04 Deadline misses** — rework from errors extends task duration
- Detail errors are downstream of FP02 (focus failure) — lapses in attention cause the errors. They don't cause other problems on the list. They are a terminal failure mode (error → rework or consequences) rather than a hub that cascades.
- Evidence: P2A multiple terminations linked specifically to detail errors [Tier 3]. Primarily a receiving problem from FP02.
- Evidence tier: 2

### FP09: Email / Communication Management Failure — Total: 11/15 *(Phase 3 revised — was 10)*

**Q1: Frequency — 4 (Daily)** *(unchanged, evidence tier improved)*
- Assessment: Email and messaging are daily activities for virtually all knowledge workers. ADHD users describe daily failures — forgetting to reply, inbox accumulation, avoidance behaviours. Phase 3 deep dive [P3A] established that prospective memory impairment (large effect sizes, d=1.60 in clinical tasks) applied to the volume of daily email strongly supports multiple daily failures. A case could be made for score 5 but relies on inference rather than direct measurement.
- Evidence: Prospective memory impairment: large effect sizes (d=1.60 for task planning, significantly impaired self-initiated retrieval) [Altgassen et al. 2014; Altgassen et al. 2019, Tier 1]. Users describe daily avoidance and forgetting to reply [P2A, Tier 3]. Practitioners describe email overwhelm as daily experience [Tier 2]. The "60% working memory impairment" figure is **unverifiable** — no primary source found; treat as Tier 4 [P3A].
- Evidence tier: 1–2 *(improved from 3)*

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 4 (Substantially differentiated)** *(unchanged, evidence tier improved)*
- Assessment: Phase 3 deep dive [P3A] confirmed substantial differentiation through: (1) Prospective memory failure as qualitatively different mechanism — ADHD users experience "read it, intended to reply, forgot" as a neurological failure, not procrastination [Tier 1]; (2) Avoidance-shame spiral driven by RSD amplifies delay beyond neurotypical email overwhelm [Tier 2]; (3) Standard email strategies (batch processing, folders, inbox zero) fail for ADHD-specific reasons — they assume prospective memory and return-to-check behaviours that ADHD impairs [Tier 2–3]. Score remains 4 not 5 because the observable failure (late/missing replies) exists on a continuum with neurotypical email overwhelm — the mechanism is qualitatively different but the outcome is not.
- Evidence: Prospective memory as distinct mechanism [Tier 1]. Four-layer convergence: prospective memory + task initiation + decision fatigue + emotional avoidance [P3A, Tier 1–2]. "Out of sight, out of mind" [P2B, Tier 3].
- Evidence tier: 1–2 *(improved from 3)*

**Q3: Connectedness — 3 (Connected)** *(raised from 2)*
- Assessment: Phase 3 deep dive [P3A] identified a direct causal link to FP04 (deadline misses) via missed action items in email. The user who was terminated for failing to send a calendar invite [P2A] demonstrates this chain. Email failure also feeds into the overwhelm-burnout cycle [P2C], with accumulated unanswered emails creating stress that worsens FP02 (focus) and FP01 (initiation) through shame-driven paralysis. The connectedness is still modest — email failure is primarily a receiving problem — but the direct link to deadline misses warrants 3 rather than 2.
- Evidence: Email → missed action items → deadline failure [P3A analysis, Tier 2]. Termination for missed calendar invite [P2A, Tier 3]. Email backlog feeds overwhelm-burnout cycle [P2C, Tier 2].
- Evidence tier: 2 *(improved from 3)*

---

### FP12: Chronic Lateness — Total: 10/15

**Q1: Frequency — 4 (Daily)**
- Assessment: For those affected, lateness is a daily risk — every scheduled commitment (work start, meetings, calls) presents an opportunity for lateness. 27.8% report this as an often/very often problem [P1A]. Not scored 5 because not every scheduled event results in lateness; it's a daily pattern but not multiple-times-per-day.
- Evidence: 27.8% often/very often [P1A, Tier 1]. "Running behind" pattern [P1A, Tier 1]. Employer ratings confirm impairment in punctuality [P1A, Tier 1].
- Evidence tier: 1

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 4 (Substantially differentiated)**
- Assessment: Many people are occasionally late, but ADHD chronic lateness is substantially different. It persists despite awareness, consequences, repeated warnings, alarms, and genuine effort. The mechanism (time blindness — inability to perceive how much preparation time has elapsed) is ADHD-specific. Standard advice ("leave earlier," "set alarms") provides partial benefit but doesn't address the underlying time-perception deficit. Users describe being late even when alarms are set because they misjudge how long getting ready takes.
- Evidence: Persistence despite consequences [P1A, Tier 1]. Time blindness mechanism [P2C, Tier 2]. 27.8% vs 7.8% prevalence — 3.6x gap [P1A, Tier 1].
- Evidence tier: 1

**Q3: Connectedness — 2 (Loosely related)**
- Assessment: Chronic lateness is a *receiving* problem — caused by FP03 (time blindness). Solving lateness wouldn't reduce other problems. It doesn't cause focus failures, prioritisation issues, or detail errors. Its consequences are interpersonal (supervisor frustration, discipline) and reputational, but those consequences were filtered out in S2 (FP14, FP15). It is a relatively isolated downstream manifestation of time blindness.
- Evidence: Direct consequence of FP03 [analysis]. No upstream causal arrows to other problems.
- Evidence tier: 1

---

### FP07: Meeting / Instruction Memory Failure — Total: 11/15 *(Phase 3 revised — was 10)*

**Q1: Frequency — 4 (Daily)** *(unchanged)*
- Assessment: Knowledge workers attend meetings and receive verbal instructions daily. For those affected, the memory failure occurs at virtually every meeting. Users describe "understanding everything being said — walking out and not 'remembering' anything" consistently. 75–81% of ADHD individuals show measurable working memory impairment [P3B, Tier 1].
- Evidence: Daily occurrence in user reports [P2A, Tier 3]. Practitioners list forgetting instructions as common presenting problem [P2C, Tier 2]. DSM-5 criterion: "often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly" [Tier 1]. Bifactor modelling: 75–81% impairment prevalence [P3B, Tier 1].
- Evidence tier: 1–2 *(improved from 2–3)*

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 5 (Highly differentiated)** *(raised from 4)*
- Assessment: Phase 3 deep dive [P3B] established that ADHD meeting-memory failure is driven by an **encoding deficit**, not a retrieval failure. Neural evidence (P3 amplitude reduction during working memory encoding) shows the ADHD brain fails to effectively encode information into memory, even while processing it in real-time. This is neurologically distinct from neurotypical forgetting, which typically involves retrieval failure (information was encoded but cannot be accessed). The encoding mechanism implies fundamentally different product design: an ADHD tool must capture everything (because encoding failure is unpredictable and the user cannot know what they've failed to encode) and proactively resurface content, rather than supplementing partial encoding as general tools assume. Even methylphenidate does not normalise memory — treated adults still show large impairments in story recall and prospective memory [P3B, Tier 1].
- Evidence: P3 encoding signal measurably lower in ADHD [Missonnier et al. 2013, Tier 1]. Encoding vs retrieval distinction confirmed [Bonilla et al. 2020, Tier 1]. Medication reduces but does not eliminate deficit [Fuermaier et al. 2016, Tier 1]. Standard note-taking creates dual-task problem for ADHD (listen + decide importance + write) [P3B, Tier 2–3].
- Evidence tier: 1 *(improved from 2–3)*
- **Rationale for raise to 5:** The encoding mechanism is a qualitatively different neurological process requiring fundamentally different design. A score of 5 requires "qualitatively different triggers, patterns, or failure modes requiring specific design" — the encoding deficit meets this criterion directly.

**Q3: Connectedness — 2 (Loosely related)** *(unchanged)*
- Assessment: Meeting memory failure is relatively isolated. It can lead to missed action items (connecting to FP04 deadline misses), but the causal chain is indirect. It shares the working-memory root cause with FP09 (email) but solving one wouldn't solve the other. It is a specific, contained failure domain.
- Evidence: Primarily isolated to verbal information retention [analysis]. Prospective memory impairment affects action items [P3B, Tier 1] but the broadcasting effect is limited.
- Evidence tier: 2–3

---

### FP11: Documentation / Administrative Paralysis — Total: 10/15

**Q1: Frequency — 4 (Daily)**
- Assessment: For roles with documentation requirements (which is most knowledge work), administrative tasks arise daily — filling in time sheets, writing meeting notes, completing reports, updating records. ADHD users describe daily avoidance of these tasks, with backlogs accumulating.
- Evidence: "Paperwork is hell" — described as constant daily struggle [P2A, Tier 3]. OT with ADHD describes ongoing paralysis completing evaluations [P2A, Tier 3].
- Evidence tier: 3

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 4 (Substantially differentiated)**
- Assessment: Documentation is boring for everyone, but the ADHD aversion is substantially different. Users describe a complete inability to start documentation tasks that goes beyond preference — "Nothing makes it NOT paperwork." The low-stimulation, high-cognitive-load nature of documentation specifically triggers ADHD task-avoidance. Standard advice (batch it, schedule it, template it) provides marginal benefit because the initiation barrier, not the process, is the problem. The combination of FP01 (initiation failure) and low-stimulation creates a uniquely severe barrier.
- Evidence: "Nothing makes it NOT paperwork" [P2A, Tier 3]. Task initiation barrier is highest for low-stimulation tasks [P2C, Tier 2]. Standard advice provides limited benefit [P2A, Tier 3].
- Evidence tier: 3

**Q3: Connectedness — 2 (Loosely related)**
- Assessment: Documentation paralysis is primarily a *receiving* problem — caused by FP01 (initiation failure applied to a specific domain). Solving documentation paralysis wouldn't reduce other problems on the list. It is a specific manifestation of initiation failure in a particularly aversive context.
- Evidence: Downstream of FP01 [analysis]. No upstream effects on other problems.
- Evidence tier: 3

---

### FP10: Context Switching Cost — Total: 9/15

**Q1: Frequency — 4 (Daily)**
- Assessment: Context switches occur multiple times daily for most knowledge workers — meetings interrupt focused work, colleagues ask questions, notifications arrive. ADHD users report the *recovery* from these switches as the primary problem, with reorientation taking 30+ minutes per switch. One user estimates 2-3 hours/day lost to reorientation.
- Evidence: "2-3 hours of my day is spent just staring at something" [P2A, Tier 4 — single user report]. 30-minute recovery after meetings [P2A, Tier 3 — programmer reports]. Daily occurrence is certain; severity data is limited.
- Evidence tier: 3–4

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 3 (Moderately differentiated)**
- Assessment: Context switching cost is a well-documented general problem (research shows 23 minutes average recovery for all workers). The ADHD version appears more severe (30+ minutes, emotional distress) but the mechanism is similar — rebuilding mental context. The differentiation is in severity rather than kind. Standard solutions (time-blocking, notification management, "Do Not Disturb" mode) work for ADHD users — they just need them more aggressively. Score 3 rather than 4 because the problem isn't qualitatively different; ADHD users need stronger versions of the same solutions.
- Evidence: General population context-switching research shows similar (though less severe) patterns [Tier 1]. ADHD-specific data is limited to user reports [P2A, Tier 3–4]. Standard solutions partially work [P2B, Tier 3].
- Evidence tier: 3

**Q3: Connectedness — 2 (Loosely related)**
- Assessment: Context switching cost is relatively isolated. It contributes to FP02 (inconsistent focus) but is not the primary cause of it. It doesn't cause time blindness, initiation failure, or prioritisation problems. It is a specific workload-environment interaction rather than a core executive function failure.
- Evidence: Shares context with focus problems but solving it wouldn't address the underlying attention deficit [analysis].
- Evidence tier: 3

### FP18: Workspace Disorganisation — Total: 8/15

**Q1: Frequency — 3 (Several times per week)**
- Assessment: The impact of disorganisation manifests when users can't find something they need — which happens several times per week rather than multiple times per day. The disorganisation itself is constant, but the *functional failure* (can't find document, lost item, cluttered workspace impeding work) occurs intermittently. Practitioners describe it as a recurring problem but not the most frequently disrupting one.
- Evidence: OT consensus identifies it as common presenting problem [P2C, Tier 2]. Users describe it as chronic state [P1C, Tier 1]. Functional impact (inability to find needed items) is several times per week rather than daily crisis.
- Evidence tier: 2

**Q2: ADHD Differentiation — 3 (Moderately differentiated)**
- Assessment: Many people have messy desks. The ADHD version is more persistent and resistant to organisation attempts, but the observable failure (can't find things, cluttered workspace) looks similar. The differentiation is that ADHD users cannot maintain organisation systems after initial setup — the maintenance fails, not the initial sorting. Standard organisation advice (filing systems, labelling) works temporarily but is abandoned within days. Score 3 because the difference is in sustainability, not in the nature of the problem.
- Evidence: Self-organisation as EF mediator [P1C, Tier 1]. "Organisation requires regular, repeated behaviours" — which ADHD impairs [P2C, Tier 2].
- Evidence tier: 2

**Q3: Connectedness — 2 (Loosely related)**
- Assessment: Workspace disorganisation shares context with other problems (wastes time finding things, contributes to feeling overwhelmed) but addressing it wouldn't meaningfully reduce time blindness, initiation failure, focus problems, or prioritisation. It is a relatively standalone problem. Digital disorganisation connects loosely to FP09 (email) but they are distinct failure domains.
- Evidence: No cascading effects described in research [analysis]. OT consensus treats it as independent intervention area [P2C, Tier 2].
- Evidence tier: 2

## Scoring Confidence Notes

### High Confidence Scores (Tier 1 evidence for key dimensions)
- FP02: All three scores backed by Tier 1 data (WFIRS, WHO, DSM)
- FP04: Frequency and differentiation backed by Tier 1 employer ratings and WHO data
- FP06: DSM criterion and WFIRS data provide strong frequency/differentiation evidence
- FP12: WFIRS data provides strong frequency and prevalence data
- FP03: EF mediation research and WFIRS data for frequency and differentiation

### Moderate Confidence Scores (Tier 2–3 primary evidence)
- FP01: High frequency is strongly supported (Tier 1 WFIRS) but differentiation relies more on user reports (Tier 2–3)
- FP05: ADDitude poll (Tier 2) for frequency; differentiation from practitioner/user evidence (Tier 2–3)
- FP08: Delay discounting well-documented (Tier 1) but frequency of avoidance pattern from user reports (Tier 2–3)

### Phase 3 Revised — Now Moderate-High Confidence (previously Lower)
- FP07: Phase 3 deep dive [P3B] elevated from Tier 2–3 to Tier 1. Encoding deficit mechanism established by neural evidence (P3 amplitude). Q2 raised from 4→5. Avg tier: 2.7→1.7.
- FP09: Phase 3 deep dive [P3A] elevated from Tier 3 to Tier 1–2. Prospective memory failure as clinical mechanism. Q3 raised from 2→3. Avg tier: 3.0→1.7. Note: the "60% working memory impairment" figure is unverifiable (Tier 4).

### Lower Confidence Scores (Tier 3–4 primary evidence)
- FP10: Frequency data from single user estimate (Tier 4); differentiation uncertain
- FP11: All evidence from user community reports (Tier 3)
