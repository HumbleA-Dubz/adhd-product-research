# What specific work tasks and behaviours do adults with ADHD most commonly fail at or struggle to maintain in professional employment?

Focus on observable workplace behaviours and task failures, not clinical symptoms or internal experiences.
For each problem identified, include: how it manifests at work, any data on frequency or prevalence, reported consequences for job performance.
From peer-reviewed research and occupational health literature. Cite specific studies with dates.

Research consistently finds that adults with ADHD who are employed are not typically failing at *one* specific task, but show clusters of observable problems in productivity, time management, reliability, interpersonal behaviour and safety. Most data come from clinic samples (so they likely over‑represent impairment) plus large epidemiological surveys.

Below, “ADHD group” refers to adults with a clinical ADHD diagnosis unless noted. Percentages are self‑reported unless stated otherwise.

***

## 1. Inefficient task completion and reduced work output

**How it manifests**

- Work takes longer than expected; tasks are left half‑finished or require others to step in.
- Frequent need to redo work because of errors or omissions.
- Difficulty prioritising; time is spent on low‑value activities while key tasks lag.
- Supervisors perceive inconsistency in output from day to day.

**Frequency / prevalence**

- In a German outpatient ADHD sample (n=134), 55% reported “often” or “very often” having **problems getting work done efficiently** (WFIRS Work item \#2) vs 11.7% in a matched community comparison group and 7.4% in the general community sample.[^1]
- 42.1% of adults with ADHD reported “problems performing required duties” often/very often vs 8.7% of controls.[^1]

Overall, more than 80% of adults with ADHD reported at least one significant work‑performance problem on the WFIRS scale, and ~60% reported three or more distinct work problems.[^1]

**Observed consequences**

- In the WHO World Mental Health Survey of 7,075 workers in 10 countries, workers with ADHD had **22.1 extra days per year** of lost role performance vs similar workers without ADHD, with **21.7 days of reduced work quantity** and **13.6 days of reduced work quality**.[^2]
- A clinical review concluded that employed adults with ADHD experience “workplace impairment and reduced productivity,” including more under‑performance and chronic work problems than non‑ADHD workers.[^3][^4]

***

## 2. Underperforming relative to skills or “working below potential”

**How it manifests**

- Employees technically meet minimal requirements but do not progress, fail to take on higher‑level responsibilities, or deliver at a level below their training or intelligence.
- Supervisors may describe them as “not living up to potential” or “coasting.”

**Frequency / prevalence**

- “Problems working to your potential” (WFIRS item \#10) was the **single most frequently endorsed work problem**: 69.2% of adults with ADHD vs 16.6% of matched controls and 9.3% of the general community reported this often/very often.[^1]
- In the same study, this under‑performance was more common than being fired, attendance problems or poor formal evaluations.[^1]

**Observed consequences**

- Many adults with ADHD report feeling they are not meeting their own standards even when formal evaluations are acceptable; Fuermaier et al. note that most impairment is experienced as “not meeting their own standards and perceived potential,” rather than constant overt job loss.[^1]
- Employer ratings in Barkley \& Murphy’s samples show lower overall work performance and more impairment in “managing daily responsibilities,” even when employment rates per se are similar.[^4]

***

## 3. Difficulty taking on and following through on new tasks

**How it manifests**

- Slow uptake of new assignments; procrastination starting unfamiliar work.
- Difficulty following multi‑step instructions; needing repeated explanations.
- Avoidance of tasks that require planning or learning a new system.

**Frequency / prevalence**

- “Problems taking on new tasks” (WFIRS item \#9) was endorsed as often/very often by 40.7% of adults with ADHD vs 9.7% of controls and 5.1% of the general community.[^1]

**Observed consequences**

- This behaviour contributes to employers rating adults with ADHD as more impaired in “completing assigned work” and “educational activities” (e.g., mandatory trainings, upskilling).[^4]
- It is one of the contributors to days of reduced work quantity and quality (presenteeism) in large surveys.[^2]

***

## 4. Tardiness (chronic lateness)

**How it manifests**

- Arriving late to work or meetings; missing the start of shifts, calls, or appointments.
- Needing frequent reminders, apologies or informal warnings for being late.
- Patterns of “running behind,” even when warned.

**Frequency / prevalence**

- “Problems with being late” (WFIRS item \#8) was reported often/very often by 27.8% of adults with ADHD vs 7.8% of controls and ~5% of the general community.[^1]

**Observed consequences**

- Employers in Barkley’s employer rating study reported significantly more impairment in **punctuality** and **meeting deadlines** for adults with ADHD than for community controls.[^4]
- Lateness feeds into negative performance reviews and formal discipline for substandard work (see Section 11).

***

## 5. Attendance problems and sickness absence

**How it manifests**

- Unplanned absences, frequent sick days, or not showing up for scheduled shifts.
- Extended periods of sick leave or “checking out” from work roles.
- Difficulty maintaining reliable presence, particularly under stress.

**Frequency / prevalence**

- “Problems with your attendance” (WFIRS item \#7) was endorsed as often/very often by 23.2% of adults with ADHD vs 9.3% of controls and ~5% of the general community.[^1]
- In the WHO survey across 10 countries, workers with ADHD had **8.4 additional sickness‑absence days per year** compared with workers without ADHD.[^2]
- A Swedish population cohort (~64,000 individuals including 9,718 with ADHD) found that those with ADHD had a 2.7‑fold higher risk of long‑term sickness absence and a 10‑fold higher risk of being granted disability pension over follow‑up than matched peers.[^5]

**Observed consequences**

- Increased risk of long‑term sickness absence and exit from the labour market (disability or rehabilitation) noted in Scandinavian cohort studies and occupational outcomes research.[^6][^5]
- Consensus occupational‑health reviews emphasise that ADHD contributes to long‑term sickness absence and work disability, especially when comorbid depression or anxiety is present.[^7][^8]

***

## 6. On‑the‑job productivity loss and missed deadlines (“presenteeism”)

**How it manifests**

- Being physically at work but:
    - Working slowly or inefficiently.
    - Producing error‑prone work that others must correct.
    - Failing to meet deadlines or needing frequent deadline extensions.
- Noticeable variability: high output on some days, markedly low on others.

**Frequency / prevalence**

- In the WHO World Mental Health survey, workers with ADHD had on average:
    - **21.7 days/year** where work quantity was reduced.
    - **13.6 days/year** where work quality was reduced.[^2]
- A US economic analysis, drawing on Kessler’s productivity data, estimated **13.6 days of ADHD‑related absenteeism** and **21.6 days of ADHD‑related presenteeism** per employed adult with ADHD per year.[^9]

**Observed consequences**

- De Graaf et al. note that more than half the total ADHD‑related productivity loss occurs on days when the worker is present, not absent—which employers often find “striking and disturbing.”[^2]
- Schein et al. estimate US work‑productivity losses (absenteeism + presenteeism) at **28.8 billion USD annually**, driven by those excess days.[^9]

***

## 7. Problems keeping a job, being fired, and chronic employment instability

**How it manifests**

- Short job tenures; difficulty remaining in the same role.
- Repeated cycles of informal warnings → poor reviews → termination.
- Impulsive decisions to quit without another job secured.
- Frequent periods of unemployment, rehabilitation, or disability benefits.

**Frequency / prevalence**

- In Fuermaier’s outpatient sample:
    - **“Problems keeping a job”** (WFIRS item \#4): 31.1% of adults with ADHD vs 13.2% of controls.[^1]
    - **“Getting fired from work”** (item \#5): 20.0% of adults with ADHD vs 11.4% of controls; 48% of high‑symptom community members also endorsed this.[^1]
- Earlier clinical work found that adults with ADHD had:
    - **More frequent job changes**, and were more likely to have **performed poorly, quit, or been fired** from jobs than adults referred to the same clinic but not diagnosed with ADHD.[^10]

**Observed consequences**

- In a large Norwegian clinical sample, only **24% of adults with ADHD** were currently in work vs 79% of a population control group.[^6]
- Another Norwegian study found that **only 22.2%** of adults with ADHD had ordinary paid work as their main income vs ~72% in the general population; the rest relied on benefits, rehabilitation or were out of the labour force.[^11]
- Adamou et al.’s international occupational‑health consensus concluded that adults with ADHD experience impairment “in all aspects related to employment, ranging from the initial job search, the interview and in employment itself.”[^7]

***

## 8. Impulsive quitting, frequent job changes, and career instability

**How it manifests**

- Quitting jobs suddenly in response to boredom, conflict or minor setbacks.
- Changing jobs or even careers without planning, often to seek stimulation.
- Starting many roles but failing to build seniority or a stable career path.

**Frequency / prevalence**

- Barkley \& Murphy’s occupational history interview found adults with ADHD had:
    - A higher **percentage of jobs they had quit due to boredom**.
    - A higher **percentage of jobs they had quit due to hostility with their employer**.
    - A higher **percentage of jobs with formal discipline for substandard work** compared with both clinical and community controls.[^4]
- Murphy \& Barkley (1996) reported that adults with ADHD had **more frequent changes in employment** than non‑ADHD clinic referrals.[^10]

**Observed consequences**

- These patterns produce fragmented CVs, lower occupational status and greater reliance on social assistance in longitudinal economic analyses of adults with ADHD.[^12][^11]
- Career‑development studies find more “decision‑making confusion,” maladaptive career beliefs, and external conflict about career direction among workers with ADHD.[^13][^4]

***

## 9. Conflicts with supervisors and difficulties with authority

**How it manifests**

- Arguments with managers, poor acceptance of feedback or corrective action.
- Perceived disrespect of rules or protocols; perceived as insubordinate.
- Overstepping boundaries (e.g., interrupting, blunt communication) in ways that strain supervisor–employee relationships.

**Frequency / prevalence**

- “Problems with your supervisor” (WFIRS item \#3) was endorsed as often/very often by 26.3% of adults with ADHD vs 12.3% of controls and 7.6% of the general community.[^1]
- Employer ratings show significantly greater impairment in **relations with supervisors** for adults with ADHD compared with community controls.[^4]

**Observed consequences**

- Higher rates of formal discipline and more jobs where “trouble getting along with others” was reported in Barkley’s structured occupational interviews.[^4]
- Supervisor conflict is a commonly cited reason for both termination and impulsive quitting in qualitative workplace reports and systematic reviews.[^13][^4]

***

## 10. Problems working in teams and with coworkers/clients

**How it manifests**

- Difficulty coordinating tasks with colleagues; missing hand‑offs.
- Interrupting others, dominating discussions, or appearing disengaged.
- Forgetting shared commitments, failing to follow through on team agreements.
- Strained relationships with clients/customers due to inconsistent follow‑up.

**Frequency / prevalence**

- “Problems working in a team” (WFIRS item \#6): 30.8% of adults with ADHD vs 11.5% of controls and around 6% in the overall community.[^1]
- Employer rating scales in Barkley’s study documented more impairment in **relations with coworkers** and **relations with clients/customers** for adults with ADHD vs controls.[^4]

**Observed consequences**

- More jobs in which adults with ADHD reported **trouble getting along with others** and **trouble with their own behaviour** at work, even after accounting for other psychiatric disorders.[^10][^4]
- Systematic review evidence highlights that unsupportive team climates and rigid social expectations at work exacerbate ADHD‑related relational problems and reduce job satisfaction and tenure.[^13]

***

## 11. Substandard work, discipline and poor performance evaluations

**How it manifests**

- Documented errors, quality problems, or missed deliverables that trigger formal warnings or performance‑improvement plans.
- Lower ratings in formal annual reviews relative to peers, especially on organisation, reliability, and meeting deadlines.

**Frequency / prevalence**

- “Poor performance evaluations” (WFIRS item \#11) was endorsed often/very often by 22.5% of adults with ADHD vs 9.4% of controls and 4.8% of the general community.[^1]
- Barkley’s structured interview asked specifically about the **percentage of jobs where the person had been formally disciplined for substandard work**; adults with ADHD had higher percentages than both clinical and community controls.[^4]

**Observed consequences**

- Clinician and employer ratings in Barkley’s 2010 study consistently showed worse overall occupational adjustment and lower work performance scores in the ADHD group, even when current employment rates were similar.[^4]
- These formal evaluations drive decisions about promotion, bonus, role allocation and, where problems persist, termination.

***

## 12. Safety‑related behaviours and workplace accidents

**How it manifests**

- Inattention to safety procedures; skipping checklists or rule steps.
- Risk‑taking with machinery or vehicles; inconsistent seatbelt or PPE use.
- Higher error rates when operating equipment, particularly in monotonous or high‑stimulus environments.

**Frequency / prevalence**

- A major review of occupational health literature concluded that adults with ADHD are at **increased risk of accidents, trauma and workplace injuries**, especially traffic‑related incidents.[^3]
- Epidemiological analysis in the WHO survey found workers with ADHD had **more than twice the risk** of sickness absence and workplace accidents than other workers.[^2][^4]
- A 2024 emergency‑department study of workers with occupational accidents used the Adult ADHD Self‑Report Scale to define an “ADHD‑potential” group. Those screening positive for ADHD had higher odds of being in the accident cohort, and workers in the ADHD‑potential group had roughly **double the odds of being in the more severe‑injury category** compared with ADHD‑unlikely workers (OR for ADHD‑unlikely ≈0.48).[^14]
- A 2025 orthopaedic trauma study of penetrating foreign‑body injuries at work similarly found significantly higher ADHD symptom scores in the injured group than in matched controls.[^15]

**Observed consequences**

- Schein et al. estimate that adults with ADHD have a **23% higher risk of road traffic accidents**, contributing to ~52,000 extra accidents per year in the US and ~2.1 billion USD in excess non‑medical accident‑related costs.[^9]
- Safety‑sensitive occupations (driving, construction, manufacturing) therefore see disproportionate injury and cost burdens when ADHD is unrecognised and unsupported.

***

## 13. Long‑term labour‑market marginalisation (disability, unemployment)

Although this goes beyond day‑to‑day “behaviours,” it is the cumulative consequence of the observable problems above.

**How it manifests**

- High rates of long‑term unemployment, vocational rehabilitation, and disability pensions.
- Periodic returns to work followed by recurrent absence or exit.

**Frequency / prevalence**

- In Halmøy et al.’s Norwegian sample of 414 adults with ADHD, **only 24% were in work**, vs 79% of population controls.[^6]
- Gjervan et al. similarly found that only **22.2%** of adults with ADHD had ordinary work as their source of income vs about 72% in the general population.[^11]
- In a Swedish population‑based cohort, young adults with ADHD had:
    - A **10.2‑fold higher risk** of disability pension.
    - A **2.7‑fold higher risk** of long‑term sickness absence.
    - A **1.7‑fold higher risk** of long‑term unemployment.[^5]

**Observed consequences**

- A 2022 US economic analysis estimated that among adults with ADHD, **unemployment costs** (lost earnings and benefits) comprised **54% of the total 122.8‑billion‑USD annual societal burden**, far exceeding direct healthcare costs.[^9]
- Occupational‑health consensus statements highlight adult ADHD as a major, but still under‑recognised, driver of work disability and labour‑market marginalisation.[^8][^7]

***

## Overall pattern

Across studies, several themes stand out:

- **Multi‑domain impairment**: In Fuermaier et al., more than 80% of adults with ADHD reported at least one significant work problem, and ~60% reported three or more; over 20% had six or more distinct work impairments.[^1]
- **Inattention‑linked behaviours are central**: Work impairments correlate most strongly with behaviours reflecting inattention—inefficient work, failure to meet potential, difficulty taking on new tasks, punctuality and attendance issues—rather than hyperactivity alone.[^4][^1]
- **Behavioural impact exceeds what neuropsychological tests predict**: Objective cognitive tests account for little variance in workplace functioning; self‑reported everyday behaviours predict work outcomes much better.[^4][^1]
- **Employers mostly observe reduced efficiency, reliability and interpersonal friction**, not just classic “hyperactivity.” These show up as:
    - Missed deadlines and low output despite presence.
    - Lateness and unreliable attendance.
    - Underuse of skills, failure to progress, and chronic job instability.
    - Recurrent performance problems, discipline, and safety incidents.

All of the behaviours summarized above are observable in routine workplace practice and have been documented across occupational‑health, neuropsychological and epidemiological studies as common and consequential in adults with ADHD.
