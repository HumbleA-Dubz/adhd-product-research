# Productivity and Task Management Tools Adults with ADHD Report Abandoning for Work

Adults with ADHD describe a remarkably consistent cycle across Reddit communities like r/ADHD, r/productivity, r/ADHDers, and others: discovering a new productivity tool, spending hours or days setting it up, using it enthusiastically for 3-14 days, then abandoning it entirely—often feeling worse than before. This report synthesizes specific tools mentioned, the work problems users were trying to solve, why each tool failed, and what users wanted instead.

---

## Notion

### Work Problem Users Were Trying to Solve
Project organization, knowledge management, task tracking across multiple work projects, creating a "second brain" for professional responsibilities.

### Why Users Abandoned It
Notion's flexibility becomes a trap for ADHD brains. Users report spending "more time tweaking templates than actually working on projects" and getting stuck in setup hyperfocus rather than productive work [^3][^39]. One r/ADHD user described it as "too flexible, lacks deadline notifications, and has poor integrations" [^27]. The mobile app is slow, there's no offline capability, and the overwhelming number of functions triggers avoidance rather than action [^3].

A recurring pattern emerges: users dive deep into Notion, build elaborate pages, then "get overwhelmed and abandon Notion" after 1-2 cycles [^39]. One user admitted: "I've spent way more time playing with Notion than actually being productive... any time I come across a new way of organizing things I can't stop myself from reorganizing my setup" [^39].

### What Users Wanted Instead
Simpler, cleaner interfaces that don't invite endless customization. Several users noted switching to Apple Notes, OneNote, or plain notebooks because "keeping it simple truly is more effective" [^10].

---

## Todoist

### Work Problem Users Were Trying to Solve
Daily task management, deadline reminders, capturing work responsibilities, GTD-style workflow organization.

### Why Users Abandoned It
Todoist assumes capabilities that ADHD fundamentally impairs. One r/ADHD user explained: "Todo apps never worked for me because they assume you're already disciplined... they assume: you estimate time well, you don't lie to yourself, your future self will act like a dependable employee. Unfortunately, that hasn't been my reality" [^2].

Users describe Todoist becoming "a mess" as tasks accumulate [^38]. The core problem: "I find them ineffective since I often forget to check or read them at all" [^2]. Another user noted that paying for Todoist created anxiety about "getting my money's worth" rather than motivation to use it [^41].

### What Users Found Helpful (When It Worked)
Voice capture for late-night thoughts, location-based reminders that trigger when physically near the task location, and natural language processing that accommodates imprecise time awareness [^6]. However, many users still cycle away from Todoist to other apps and back repeatedly [^37].

---

## Trello

### Work Problem Users Were Trying to Solve
Visual project tracking, kanban-style workflow management, keeping track of work tasks and their status.

### Why Users Abandoned It
Trello's visual nature becomes counterproductive. One user stated: "Trello ABSOLUTELY exacerbates my ADHD symptoms... Way too visually stimulating for this brain. I become too preoccupied in the organizational element and become distracted or unproductive" [^17].

Multiple users describe accumulating "abandoned Trello boards" and "dead Trellos" that represent abandoned work systems [^29]. The data entry overhead isn't worth it for individual use, and the stimulating interface becomes a distraction rather than a tool [^23].

### What Users Wanted Instead
Linear, simple lists with minimal visual complexity. One user switched to Bear Note: "It's so clean and so much whitespace makes me feel serene" [^17].

---

## ClickUp

### Work Problem Users Were Trying to Solve
Comprehensive project management, tracking hundreds of personal and work projects, managing tasks across multiple life areas.

### Why Users Abandoned It
ClickUp's extensive features create paralysis. Users describe it as "overly customizable and granular, leading to overwhelm after just two weeks of use" [^27]. One r/ClickUp user with ADHD explained: "My primary issue with ClickUp is the overwhelming number of options, which can lead to feeling swamped by all my ideas and tasks" [^33].

The tool that's supposed to reduce overwhelm becomes another source of it. As one user noted, creating systems and a "second brain" can lead to "distraction, procrastination, and what I call productivity theater" [^33].

### What Users Wanted Instead
More visual, less taxing approaches. One user switched to Teamhood: "It's straightforward enough that I've been able to maintain my usage consistently" [^31].

---

## Asana

### Work Problem Users Were Trying to Solve
Team project management, work task assignment, deadline tracking, workflow organization for professional responsibilities.

### Why Users Abandoned It
Asana is described as "too structured" [^9]. Users struggle with view configurations: "If I use a Kanban view, I only see my tasks and not the whole project (which means I can't immediately gauge how long the task will take, how to prioritize)" [^34]. Switching between views creates friction, and the structure doesn't accommodate ADHD's non-linear working style.

One entrepreneur described cycling through "Asana → Airtable → Notion → back to pen and paper → then my notes app → then ClickUp" every six months, calling system-switching her actual consistent behavior [^21].

---

## Jira, Monday.com, and Enterprise Project Management Tools

### Work Problem Users Were Trying to Solve
Work-mandated task tracking, team project management, professional accountability and progress reporting.

### Why Users Abandoned Them (or Struggle With Them)
These tools require significant manual input and don't simplify the cognitive load. One user explained: "I haven't observed significant enhancements in organizational efficiency—unless these tools are seamlessly woven into existing workflows. More often than not, they pull users into a cycle of overwhelming busywork" [^1].

The integration problem is central: "Any form of integration with Microsoft was messy... Productivity tools work best when they are integrated into workflow processes. They are at their worst when you have to add extra steps to shoe-horn them into what you do every day" [^1].

---

## Bullet Journals and Paper Planners

### Work Problem Users Were Trying to Solve
Flexible organization, daily task capture, combining work and personal tracking, avoiding digital overwhelm.

### Why Users Abandoned Them
ADHD users describe bullet journals as requiring consistency they cannot maintain. One user explained: "I've tried bujo before but failed. Even with a passion planner with calendars and everything laid out, I just couldn't be consistent enough to fill it out" [^72].

The aesthetic pressure worsens outcomes: "My ADHD eventually got the better of me. I basically started losing interest in decorating and slacked on drafting up the coming weeks, which translated into not having anywhere to write down homework" [^78]. Pre-formatted planners create shame: "I will forget days, I'll forget weeks. If the journal has pre-written pages, I get really affected by seeing how much time has passed, how many days I've failed" [^72].

### What Helped Some Users
Abandoning aesthetics entirely: "Go to the original work of Ryder Carroll... it was never meant to be perfectionist. That's the beauty of it. It got co-opted by artsy people" [^75]. Using cheap notebooks with zero pressure, and creating systems that don't judge missed days [^72].

---

## The Pomodoro Technique

### Work Problem Users Were Trying to Solve
Focus management, time awareness, breaking work into manageable chunks, overcoming procrastination.

### Why Users Abandoned It
The technique interrupts the hyperfocus that ADHD brains rely on for productive work. One programmer explained: "Pomodoro actually hits that 'sour spot' of interrupting you 25-minutes or so after you warm up and focused" [^81].

For many, restarting is harder than starting: "For me, ADHD means I can't get started easily. So if I start but try to stop every 25 mins and then start again? That's 2 opportunities for failure an hour" [^81]. The prescribed breaks become rabbit holes: "If I take 5 minutes off every 20 minutes, I can guarantee you that that 5 minutes will turn into 30" [^81].

One user summarized: "Once I've finally convinced myself to start, it's best for me not to get in the way of that train. The focus conductor is in charge now and I'm simply along for the ride" [^79].

---

## Habitica, Finch, and Gamified Apps

### Work Problem Users Were Trying to Solve
Habit formation, motivation through rewards, making mundane tasks more engaging, accountability.

### Why Users Abandoned Them
The gamification creates additional obligations. One user explained about Finch: "Managing a virtual pet can sometimes feel like just another responsibility that I'm not keeping up with. Rather than being enjoyable, it often contributes to my growing list of tasks" [^44].

Habitica's notification system is buggy, sometimes completing the wrong task [^100]. More fundamentally, these apps don't accommodate irregular schedules: "My life lacks a consistent daily routine since my school and work schedules are always changing. This inconsistency makes it impossible to establish regular tasks for my morning or bedtime routines" [^106].

---

## OmniFocus and Things 3

### Work Problem Users Were Trying to Solve
GTD-style comprehensive task management, handling complex work projects with subtasks and dependencies.

### Why Users Abandoned Them
OmniFocus is powerful but creates its own overhead: "I ended up spending more time managing the tasks than doing them" [^87]. Basic apps display too much information without easy filtering, creating overwhelm [^93].

Things 3 is often praised for relative simplicity, with headings that "help me to break down a project mentally" without the complexity of OmniFocus [^87]. However, users still struggle with the fundamental issue: "Neither will actually make you take action" [^96].

---

## Google Calendar and Google Tasks

### Work Problem Users Were Trying to Solve
Time blocking, scheduling, deadline management, visual daily planning.

### Why Users Abandoned Them
The core problem: forgetting to check them. One user described: "My ADHD brain constantly forgets to check my calendar. And if I do start on a task, I forget to follow the rest of the tasks scheduled on my calendar... I've experimented with setting reminders for calendar events, but I soon become desensitized to them and stop paying attention" [^62].

Multiple steps create friction: "Having to manually add the Asana into a GTask and those into my GCal is a step too many for my brain to remember to do correctly" [^62].

---

## Obsidian

### Work Problem Users Were Trying to Solve
Note-taking, knowledge management, task management linked to working notes, personal knowledge base.

### Why Users Abandoned It (or Struggle With It)
Obsidian shares Notion's customization trap: "Do I use Obsidian retooling and nitpicking as a form of task avoidance? Yes" [^58]. Users describe vaults "full of disconnected ideas, abandoned workflows, and forgotten half-baked drafts" with systems that "never stick" [^70].

However, some ADHD users find success precisely because the customization prevents app-switching: "Most organizational systems tend to lose their effectiveness over time... However, Obsidian stands out due to its high level of customization; it offers an ongoing journey of enhancement and experimentation" [^58].

---

## Core Patterns: Why These Tools Fail for ADHD Brains

### 1. The Setup Hyperfocus Trap
Users spend days or weeks perfecting their system, mistaking configuration for productivity. "I'd try various methods like apps, gamification, habit formation techniques... but they haven't been effective for me" because the system-building becomes the activity [^1].

### 2. The "Out of Sight, Out of Mind" Problem
Every app requires remembering it exists. One analysis stated: "This is the FUNDAMENTAL mistake, those apps will NEVER WORK because you have to remember to look at them, which you won't" [^89].

### 3. The Shame Spiral
Overdue tasks accumulate, creating emotional barriers to opening the app. Users describe "the wave of shame that hits when I finally open the app after two weeks of neglect and see... 73 overdue tasks glaring at me. At that point, I'd rather just uninstall the app than confront the reality of it" [^44].

### 4. Assumption of Existing Discipline
Tools assume the very capabilities ADHD impairs: "Traditional to-do apps assume: you have a good grasp of time estimation, you're honest with yourself, your future self will act like a dependable employee" [^2]. They assume "once you write a task down, you'll naturally take the next step. But ADHD brains often struggle with initiation. The gap between planning and doing can feel insurmountable" [^11].

### 5. The Maintenance Burden
Productivity tools become productivity killers: "The tool itself turns into another task I need to oversee" [^7]. Users note "how much mental effort I expended on maintaining the system rather than focusing on the actual tasks at hand" [^10].

## What ADHD Users Report Wanting Instead

Based on community discussions, users consistently describe wanting:

1. **External structure without internal organization**: Systems that organize for you rather than expecting you to organize yourself [^16]

2. **Low-friction capture**: Voice input, quick capture, minimal steps to add tasks [^6]

3. **Proactive intervention**: Tools that "intervene before we get stuck, not assistants waiting for us to remember to ask" [^47]

4. **Reduced decisions, not more options**: "An effective productivity app for ADHD reduces choices rather than adds them. It offers the next best step, not a demanding list of decisions" [^16]

5. **Respect for variable energy**: Systems that accommodate hyperfocus when it happens and low-energy days when they happen [^16]

6. **Integration with existing workflow**: "Productivity tools work best when they are integrated into workflow processes" rather than requiring additional steps [^1]

7. **Simplicity over features**: "Keeping it simple truly is more effective" [^10]. Many users ultimately return to paper, pen, or the most basic apps [^1]

8. **Accountability without shame**: Systems that don't create visible records of failure [^44]

---

## Tools That Some ADHD Users Report Sustained Success With

- **Amazing Marvin**: High customization prevents app-switching urges; can change layout instead of abandoning tool [^45][^48]
- **Sunsama**: Guided daily planning with forced time estimation and end-of-day review [^88][^91]
- **Apple Notes/Google Keep**: Brutally simple, low friction [^47]
- **Focusmate**: External accountability through body doubling [^4]
- **Plain notebooks**: No judgment for missed days, zero setup time [^72]

The consistent theme: tools that work are either extremely simple or provide external structure that doesn't depend on the user's memory or motivation to be effective.
