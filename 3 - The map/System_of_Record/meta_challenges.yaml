Novelty Decay and Intervention Habituation:
  id: MC1
  plain_language: >
    ADHD brains habituate to interventions as novelty fades.
    The tool that works brilliantly in week one may be invisible
    by week four — not because it stopped being useful, but
    because the brain stopped registering it as stimulating.
    This is neurological, not a UX failure.

Circular Dependency:
  id: MC2
  plain_language: >
    Every ADHD tool requires the user to engage with it using
    the very cognitive functions the tool compensates for.
    You need to remember to use the tool that helps you
    remember. You need to initiate use of the tool that helps
    you initiate. This is structural and irreducible — it can
    only be asymptotically reduced.

    Prospective memory: 52% of ADHD participants forgot a
    naturalistic task vs 21% controls. Task initiation: 40.7%
    report problems often/very often. SMS reminders increased
    login at module 2 only — the reminder itself habituates.
    "Those apps will NEVER WORK because you have to remember
    to look at them, which you won't."

Shame-Avoidance Spiral:
  id: MC3
  plain_language: >
    When the user falls behind, the tool generates visible
    evidence of failure — overdue counts, broken streaks,
    unprocessed queues. This triggers shame that makes
    re-engagement less likely, not more. The tool designed
    to help becomes a source of pain. Distinct from novelty
    decay: this operates even when the user wants to return.

  key_evidence: >
    "73 overdue tasks glaring at me — I'd rather uninstall
    the app than confront the reality." Pre-formatted planners
    create shame from blank pages. Non-adapted CBT worsened
    self-esteem, increased sense of failure. Users who praised
    sustained tools (plain notebooks, Amazing Marvin) cited
    "no judgment for missed days."

Disclosure and Workplace Visibility Constraint:
  id: MC4
  plain_language: >
    Using an ADHD-specific tool in a workplace creates
    disclosure risk — an "ADHD Planner" visible during
    screen-share, a bot with a neurodivergent brand. Many
    ADHD adults have not disclosed at work and fear
    discrimination. The tool must serve ADHD-specific needs
    while being invisible or neutral in workplace contexts.
  severity: High
  evidence_tier: Tier 2-3
  clusters_affected: [A, B, C]
  claims: [C026]
  favours_models:
    - Passive Capture and Structured Delivery
    - Ambient Monitor and Intervene
    - Periodic Injection
  disfavours_models:
    - Structured Check-In
  key_evidence: >
    Practitioners report consistent disclosure dilemma across
    clients: fear of discrimination, uncertainty, managers
    who don't know how to respond. Most successful ADHD-
    adjacent tools (Motion, Sunsama, Reclaim) brand as
    general productivity. Granola's bot-free approach is
    commercially validated partly by removing the social signal.

Notification Desensitisation:
  id: MC5
  plain_language: >
    ADHD brains desensitise to repeated notifications faster
    than neurotypical brains. Alarms, push notifications, and
    email reminders lose effectiveness within weeks as the
    brain filters them as non-novel. Even a perfectly designed
    intervention fails if the notification that delivers it
    is no longer perceived.
  severity: Moderate-High
  evidence_tier: Tier 2-3
  clusters_affected: [A, B]
  claims: [C022, C021]
  favours_models:
    - Passive Capture and Structured Delivery
    - Ambient Monitor and Intervene
  disfavours_models:
    - Structured Check-In
    - Calibration Feedback Loop
  key_evidence: >
    SMS reminders for ADHD interventions increased login at
    module 2 only — no effect on remaining modules. Pomodoro
    failure is the canonical example. "I soon become
    desensitised to them and stop paying attention." Alarm
    fatigue documented across every time-management tool
    category.
