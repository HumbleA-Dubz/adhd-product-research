# clusters.yaml
# Observed co-occurrence groupings of functional problems.
# Clusters describe WHAT goes together. Mechanisms (separate
# file) describe WHY.
#
# Three clusters emerged from practitioner-documented cascades,
# multi-domain impairment data, and mediation analysis.
# Four standalone problems did not cluster.

Cluster A — Time-Perception Cascade:
  id: CL_A
  hub: Time Estimation and Time Blindness (FP03)
  members:
    - problem: Time Estimation and Time Blindness
      role: hub
      evidence: >
        Q3 connectedness 5/5. Addressing time blindness directly
        reduces FP04, FP12, and partially FP08.
    - problem: Deadline Misses
      role: receiver
      evidence: >
        Misjudged duration leads to insufficient time allocated.
        Also receives from Cluster C (focus failures).
    - problem: Chronic Lateness
      role: receiver
      evidence: >
        Misjudged preparation/travel time. Direct manifestation
        of time-perception deficit.
    - problem: Long-Term Project Neglect
      role: partial receiver
      evidence: >
        Delay discounting is a time-perception failure — distant
        deadlines create zero urgency because time horizon is
        compressed. Also receives from Cluster B (initiation).
  primary_mechanism: Time Perception Distortion
  causal_direction: >
    Single hub radiating outward. FP03 causes FP04, FP12,
    and partially FP08. No bidirectional causation within
    the cluster.
  claims: [C008, C009, C010]

Cluster B — Initiation-Execution Bottleneck:
  id: CL_B
  hub: Task Initiation Failure (FP01)
  members:
    - problem: Task Initiation Failure
      role: hub
      evidence: >
        Q3 connectedness 4/5. Initiation barrier applied to
        different task types produces the two downstream problems.
    - problem: Long-Term Project Neglect
      role: receiver
      evidence: >
        Initiation barrier is highest for low-urgency, low-
        stimulation strategic work. Also receives from Cluster A.
    - problem: Documentation and Administrative Paralysis
      role: receiver
      evidence: >
        Documentation is maximally aversive to initiate — low
        stimulation plus high effort plus no immediate reward.
  primary_mechanism: Reward and Activation Processing
  causal_direction: >
    Single hub radiating outward. FP01 causes FP08 and FP11
    through the same mechanism (activation energy exceeds
    capacity) applied to task types with decreasing stimulation.
  claims: [C011, C012]
  derived_from: Our_S4

Cluster C — Attention-Quality Chain:
  id: CL_C
  hub: Inconsistent Focus (FP02)
  members:
    - problem: Inconsistent Focus
      role: hub
      evidence: >
        Q3 connectedness 4/5. Focus lapses produce both errors
        (FP06) and insufficient output (FP04).
    - problem: Attention-to-Detail Errors
      role: receiver
      evidence: >
        Focus lapses during task execution produce errors of
        oversight that survive self-checking.
    - problem: Deadline Misses
      role: shared receiver
      evidence: >
        Low-productivity days accumulate into insufficient
        output by deadline. Also receives from Cluster A.
  primary_mechanism: Attention Allocation Dysfunction
  causal_direction: >
    Single hub radiating outward. FP02 causes FP06 directly
    and FP04 through accumulated productivity loss. FP04 is
    a convergence point receiving from both Cluster A and C.
  claims: [C001, C002, C006]

# CROSS-CLUSTER INTERACTIONS

Cross-Cluster Amplifier — Prioritisation:
  id: CL_AMP
  type: amplifier
  problem: Prioritisation Failure (FP05)
  affects: [CL_A, CL_B, CL_C]
  mechanism: >
    FP05 worsens all clusters: can't prioritise which deadlines
    matter (A), prioritises easy over strategic work — procrastivity
    (B), focuses on wrong tasks amplifying limited focus capacity (C).
  claims: [C012, C013]
  derived_from: Our_S4

Cross-Cluster Receiver — Deadline Misses:
  id: CL_CONV_FP04
  type: convergence_point
  problem: Deadline Misses (FP04)
  receives_from: [CL_A, CL_C]
  mechanism: >
    Receives causal pressure from time blindness (insufficient
    time allocated) and focus failure (insufficient output
    produced). Eliminating deadline misses likely requires
    addressing both upstream causes.
  derived_from: Our_S4

Cross-Cluster Receiver — Long-Term Project Neglect:
  id: CL_CONV_FP08
  type: convergence_point
  problem: Long-Term Project Neglect (FP08)
  receives_from: [CL_A, CL_B]
  mechanism: >
    Receives from time blindness (delay discounting compresses
    time horizon) and initiation failure (activation energy
    highest for low-urgency work). Effective intervention likely
    requires addressing both.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# STANDALONE PROBLEMS
# Did not cluster. Documented here for completeness.
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Standalone — Meeting Memory Failure:
  id: CL_STANDALONE_FP07
  type: standalone
  problem: Meeting and Instruction Memory Failure (FP07)
  reason: >
    Encoding deficit operates independently of time perception,
    initiation, and focus. Occurs even when user is fully
    engaged. Shares working memory root with FP09 but solving
    one wouldn't solve the other — contexts and failure modes
    differ.
  derived_from: Our_S4

Standalone — Email Management Failure:
  id: CL_STANDALONE_FP09
  type: standalone
  problem: Email and Communication Management Failure (FP09)
  reason: >
    Involves a specific combination of initiation, prospective
    memory, and avoidance in a contained domain. Connects
    loosely to FP01 (initiation) and FP07 (memory) but neither
    fully explains the email-specific avoidance cycle.
  derived_from: Our_S4

Standalone — Context Switching Cost:
  id: CL_STANDALONE_FP10
  type: standalone
  problem: Context Switching Cost (FP10)
  reason: >
    Environmental/workload interaction more than core EF failure.
    Influenced by meeting culture and notification environment
    (partially outside individual control). Shares context with
    FP02 (focus) but mechanistically different.
  derived_from: Our_S4

Standalone — Workspace Disorganisation:
  id: CL_STANDALONE_FP18
  type: standalone
  problem: Workspace Disorganisation (FP18)
  reason: >
    Shares self-organisation EF deficit with Cluster B but
    operates in a different domain (physical/digital
    environment, not task execution). Lowest score in the set.
