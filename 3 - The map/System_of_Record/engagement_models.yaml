# engagement_models.yaml
# Structurally distinct ways a product could engage ADHD users.
# Describes the relationship between user and product: when
# interaction occurs, who initiates, what effort the user
# expends, and what the product does without user input.
#
# Dimensions:
#   A: Initiation — User-initiated <---> Product-initiated
#   B: Effort — High effort <---> Zero effort
#   C: Timing — Before / During / After problem
#   D: Continuity — Separate surface <---> Embedded in existing tools

Ambient Monitor and Intervene:
  id: M1
  plain_language: >
    The product watches your work in the background. When it
    detects you're stuck — stalling, switching tabs, overrunning
    time — it intervenes. You don't ask for help; it notices
    and acts. Intervention is graded: lightest touch first,
    escalating only if the problem persists.
  dimensions:
    initiation: Strongly product-initiated
    effort: Near-zero
    timing: During problem
    continuity: Embedded (desktop agent or browser extension)
  retention_risk: >
    Does not depend on habit formation. Risk is nudge fatigue —
    if interventions become ignorable, the tool degrades into
    another notification to dismiss.
  habit_burden: Minimal
  primary_problems:
    - Task Initiation Failure (FP01)
  secondary_problems:
    - Inconsistent Focus (FP02)
    - Time Estimation and Time Blindness (FP03)
  meta_challenge_vulnerability:
    MC1_novelty_decay: Moderate — interventions may habituate
    MC2_circular_dependency: Low — always-on, no initiation needed
    MC3_shame_spiral: Low — no visible failure accumulation
    MC4_disclosure: Moderate — desktop agent visible in taskbar
    MC5_notification: High — depends on notifications landing

Passive Capture and Structured Delivery:
  id: M2
  plain_language: >
    The product automatically captures information from your
    meetings, emails, and chats — information you'd otherwise
    forget. You change nothing about how you work. It processes
    what it captures and delivers structured summaries and
    extracted commitments at the moment you need them.
  dimensions:
    initiation: Strongly product-initiated
    effort: Zero
    timing: After problem (captures during, delivers later)
    continuity: Embedded (meeting platform, email client)
  retention_risk: >
    Strongest retention of any model. Value compounds over time
    as the knowledge graph grows. Does not depend on habit
    formation — scored 5/5 on behavioural change. The only
    architecture where "app graveyard" may be structurally
    mitigated.
  habit_burden: None
  primary_problems:
    - Meeting and Instruction Memory Failure (FP07)
    - Email and Communication Management Failure (FP09)
  secondary_problems: []
  meta_challenge_vulnerability:
    MC1_novelty_decay: Low — compounding value creates switching cost
    MC2_circular_dependency: Low — zero user initiation required
    MC3_shame_spiral: Low — continues working during absence
    MC4_disclosure: Moderate — meeting bot may be visible
    MC5_notification: Low — value delivery, not interruption

Modality Shift:
  id: M3
  plain_language: >
    Changes the input channel from writing (high activation
    barrier) to speaking (low barrier). You talk through your
    work; the product transforms it into professional output.
    Same cognitive work, different channel. Addresses the blank
    page problem directly.
  dimensions:
    initiation: User-initiated (optionally product-prompted)
    effort: Moderate
    timing: During problem
    continuity: Separate surface (mostly standalone)
  retention_risk: >
    Moderate. Per-use value — each use is independent, no
    compounding. Risk is that editing AI output re-triggers the
    same paralysis the tool was meant to avoid.
  habit_burden: Moderate
  primary_problems:
    - Documentation and Administrative Paralysis (FP11)
  secondary_problems: []
  meta_challenge_vulnerability:
    MC1_novelty_decay: Moderate — per-use tool, no habituation loop
    MC2_circular_dependency: Moderate — user must remember it exists
    MC3_shame_spiral: Low — no state to accumulate failure
    MC4_disclosure: Low — voice input is commonplace
    MC5_notification: Low — not notification-dependent

Intelligent Reordering and Decision Reduction:
  id: M4
  plain_language: >
    Sits on top of your existing task system and decides what
    to show you based on what you're likely to actually do
    right now — not just what's "important." Reduces your
    decision from "pick from 50 items" to "do this one thing."
    Bridges the gap between neurologically accessible and
    genuinely important.
  dimensions:
    initiation: Balanced — user opens, product decides what to show
    effort: Low
    timing: Before problem
    continuity: Embedded (layer on existing task tool)
  retention_risk: >
    Moderate to good. Algorithm improves with use, creating
    mild switching cost. Risk is "out of sight, out of mind" —
    user must open or check the tool. Mitigated by pushing
    top task via notification.
  habit_burden: Low
  primary_problems:
    - Prioritisation Failure (FP05)
  secondary_problems:
    - Task Initiation Failure (FP01)
  meta_challenge_vulnerability:
    MC1_novelty_decay: Moderate — algorithm learning creates some stickiness
    MC2_circular_dependency: Moderate — user must open the tool
    MC3_shame_spiral: Moderate — task list can accumulate
    MC4_disclosure: Low — appears as general productivity layer
    MC5_notification: Moderate — depends on push if used
  claims: [C012, C013]

Calibration Feedback Loop:
  id: M5
  plain_language: >
    Collects data on how long things actually take versus your
    estimates, then feeds back the discrepancy. Holds up a
    mirror that the ADHD brain cannot hold for itself. Over
    time, calibrates your internal model against reality.
  dimensions:
    initiation: Balanced — user estimates, product feeds back
    effort: Moderate
    timing: Before and during problem
    continuity: Partially embedded (calendar integration + own surface)
  retention_risk: >
    Compounding value as calibration data accumulates. But
    breaks entirely if the user stops estimating — the loop
    depends on a micro-habit. Cold start problem is real.
  habit_burden: Moderate
  primary_problems:
    - Time Estimation and Time Blindness (FP03)
  secondary_problems: []
  meta_challenge_vulnerability:
    MC1_novelty_decay: Moderate — value compounds but requires active use
    MC2_circular_dependency: High — user must estimate to get value
    MC3_shame_spiral: High — calibration data shows failures
    MC4_disclosure: Low — looks like a productivity timer
    MC5_notification: Moderate — overrun alerts may habituate
  claims: [C008, C009]

Periodic Injection into Existing Workflow:
  id: M6
  plain_language: >
    Monitors your long-term projects for engagement decay.
    When a project is being neglected, injects small concrete
    tasks into your existing daily workflow. You don't go to
    the product — it comes to you with a 15-minute action that
    bridges present you and the neglected obligation.
  dimensions:
    initiation: Strongly product-initiated
    effort: Low per interaction
    timing: Before problem (preventive)
    continuity: Embedded (injects into existing task flow)
  retention_risk: >
    Does not depend on habit formation. Risk is quality of
    injected tasks — if generic ("check on Project X"), the
    tool becomes another ignored reminder. Must be specific
    and genuinely useful.
  habit_burden: Minimal
  primary_problems:
    - Long-Term Project Neglect (FP08)
  secondary_problems: []
  meta_challenge_vulnerability:
    MC1_novelty_decay: Moderate — injected tasks may habituate
    MC2_circular_dependency: Low — product pushes to user
    MC3_shame_spiral: Low — tasks appear fresh, not as backlog
    MC4_disclosure: Low — tasks appear in existing tool
    MC5_notification: Moderate — depends on task notifications
  claims: [C013]
  derived_from: Our_L2

Structured Check-In and Guided Routine:
  id: M7
  plain_language: >
    Walks you through a daily planning ritual: review
    commitments, estimate durations, pick priorities, reflect
    at end of day. The structure is external — the product
    provides scaffolding that the ADHD brain cannot generate.
    Mirrors the coaching model. The paradox: most recommended
    by practitioners, most abandoned by users.
  dimensions:
    initiation: Product-prompted, user-executed
    effort: Moderate
    timing: Before problem (preventive planning)
    continuity: Separate surface (dedicated check-in view)
  retention_risk: >
    Highest risk of any model. Critically dependent on habit
    formation. If the user misses a few days, overdue items
    accumulate and trigger the shame spiral. The "app graveyard"
    is largely a Structured Check-In graveyard.
  habit_burden: Highest
  primary_problems:
    - Task Initiation Failure (FP01)
    - Time Estimation and Time Blindness (FP03)
    - Prioritisation Failure (FP05)
  secondary_problems: []
  meta_challenge_vulnerability:
    MC1_novelty_decay: Very high — fixed routine habituates
    MC2_circular_dependency: Very high — user must show up
    MC3_shame_spiral: Very high — missed days accumulate visibly
    MC4_disclosure: Moderate — ADHD-branded planners are visible
    MC5_notification: High — depends on check-in reminders
  claims: [C029, C030, C031]

On-Demand Cognitive Scaffolding:
  id: M8
  plain_language: >
    Available when you're stuck. You bring a complex task; it
    breaks it into micro-steps, drafts a starting point, or
    generates a decision framework. The executive function
    support your brain cannot provide at that moment, on demand.
  dimensions:
    initiation: User-initiated
    effort: Low to moderate
    timing: During problem
    continuity: Either separate or embedded
  retention_risk: >
    Moderate. Episodic use — no degradation without use but
    no compounding either. Risk is the user forgetting the
    tool exists when stuck, which is precisely the "out of
    sight, out of mind" problem.
  habit_burden: Low
  primary_problems:
    - Task Initiation Failure (FP01)
    - Documentation and Administrative Paralysis (FP11)
  secondary_problems: []
  meta_challenge_vulnerability:
    MC1_novelty_decay: Low — per-use, no routine to decay
    MC2_circular_dependency: High — user must self-identify stuck state
    MC3_shame_spiral: Low — no state, no failure accumulation
    MC4_disclosure: Low — looks like any AI assistant
    MC5_notification: Low — not notification-dependent
