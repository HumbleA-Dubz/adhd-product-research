Time Perception Distortion:
  id: MECH01
  plain_language: >
    The inability to sense how much time has passed or how much
    time something will take. Not poor planning — the internal
    clock runs differently. An hour can feel like ten minutes.
    A deadline three days away feels as distant as one three
    months away.
  affects_problems:
    - Time Blindness (primary)
    - Deadline Misses
    - Chronic Lateness
  underlies_challenges:
    - Notification Desensitisation (partially — timing of
      notifications relative to perceived urgency)
  favours_models:
    - Ambient Monitor and Intervene (real-time time awareness)
    - Calibration Feedback Loop (estimation vs actual)
  disfavours_models:
    - On-Demand Scaffolding (requires user to notice time has
      passed, which is the deficit)
    - Modality Shift (changes input channel, not time perception)
  variability: >
    Moderate. Some individuals experience more stable time
    distortion; others see meaningful variation by day or context.
  evidence: [C008, C009, C010]
  does_not_explain: >
    Task initiation failure — a person can be aware that time
    is passing and still not start. Initiation is primarily a
    reward/activation problem, not a time-perception problem.

Reward and Activation Processing:
  id: MECH02
  plain_language: >
    The brain's activation system runs on interest, novelty,
    urgency, and challenge — not importance. Tasks that lack
    these qualities cannot generate the activation energy
    needed to start or sustain work. Distant deadlines create
    near-zero urgency. Familiar tasks create near-zero novelty.
    The result: the important-but-boring thing never gets done.
  affects_problems:
    - Task Initiation Failure (primary)
    - Long-Term Project Neglect
    - Documentation Paralysis
    - Prioritisation Failure (partially — interest overrides
      importance in task selection)
  underlies_challenges:
    - Novelty Decay (directly — the product itself is subject
      to the same habituation)
    - Notification Desensitisation (partially — notifications
      lose novelty)
  favours_models:
    - Ambient Monitor and Intervene (bypasses the need for
      self-initiated activation)
    - Intelligent Reordering (matches tasks to current
      activation state)
    - Periodic Injection (creates artificial entry points)
  disfavours_models:
    - Structured Check-In (requires self-initiated daily
      engagement — competing against the deficit)
    - On-Demand Scaffolding (requires user to notice and
      seek help — a meta-initiation problem)
  variability: >
    Highly variable. Medication, sleep, novelty of current
    context, and mood all modulate activation thresholds.
    What a person can start on Monday may be impossible on
    Tuesday.
  evidence: [C011, C012, C013]
  does_not_explain: >
    Meeting memory failure — a person can be fully activated
    and engaged in a meeting but still fail to encode or
    remember commitments. Encoding is a separate mechanism.

Prospective Memory Failure:
  id: MECH03
  plain_language: >
    Forgetting to do things you intended to do. Not forgetting
    facts — forgetting intentions. You read the email and
    decided to reply after lunch. After lunch, the intention
    is gone. You left the meeting knowing you committed to send
    a document. By the time you reach your desk, the commitment
    has vanished. "Out of sight, out of mind" is the defining
    experience.
  affects_problems:
    - Meeting Memory Failure (partially — the commitment
      follow-through component)
    - Email Management Failure (the "read and forgot" pattern)
    - Long-Term Project Neglect (partially — forgetting to
      check on distant projects)
  underlies_challenges:
    - Circular Dependency (directly — forgetting to use the
      tool is a prospective memory failure)
  favours_models:
    - Passive Capture and Structured Delivery (captures
      commitments the user will forget)
    - Periodic Injection (resurfaces neglected commitments)
  disfavours_models:
    - Structured Check-In (user must remember to attend)
    - On-Demand Scaffolding (user must remember the tool
      exists at the moment of need)
    - Calibration Feedback Loop (user must remember to estimate)
  variability: >
    Relatively stable. Prospective memory failure is one of
    the more consistent ADHD deficits — less variable across
    days and contexts than activation or attention.
  evidence: [C016, C017, C019]
  does_not_explain: >
    Why users cannot start tasks they are looking directly at.
    Prospective memory is about absent cues — the intention
    is not in front of you. When the task IS in front of you
    and you still can't start, that is activation, not memory.

Encoding Deficit:
  id: MECH04
  plain_language: >
    Information does not get stored during real-time processing,
    even when the person is engaged and comprehending. You
    understood everything in the meeting. You were paying
    attention. But the information never made it into memory.
    This is not a retrieval problem — the information was never
    encoded in the first place.
  affects_problems:
    - Meeting Memory Failure (primarily — the encoding component)
    - Attention-to-Detail Errors (partially — details not
      encoded during processing lead to errors in output)
  underlies_challenges: []
  favours_models:
    - Passive Capture and Structured Delivery (creates external
      record of what encoding failed to capture)
  disfavours_models:
    - Any model that assumes the user retained information from
      a meeting, conversation, or reading session
  variability: >
    Relatively stable. Encoding deficit is a consistent
    impairment, less affected by day-to-day variation than
    attention or activation.
  evidence: [C014, C015, C016]
  does_not_explain: >
    Task initiation or prioritisation. Encoding deficit affects
    information retention, not decision-making or activation.
    A person can have perfect encoding and still not start work.

Attention Allocation Dysfunction:
  id: MECH05
  plain_language: >
    The inability to voluntarily direct and sustain focus where
    you choose. This produces BOTH hypofocus (attention drifts
    without awareness) AND hyperfocus (attention locks onto
    something stimulating and cannot be redirected). The same
    mechanism — dysregulated allocation — creates opposite
    presentations depending on the stimulus.
  affects_problems:
    - Inconsistent Focus (primary)
    - Attention-to-Detail Errors
    - Context Switching Cost
  underlies_challenges:
    - Novelty Decay (partially — focus tools themselves
      habituate as stimuli)
    - Notification Desensitisation (notifications must break
      through dysregulated attention to have effect)
  favours_models:
    - Ambient Monitor and Intervene (detects focus drift in
      real time)
    - Intelligent Reordering (matches tasks to current
      focus/energy state)
  disfavours_models:
    - Modality Shift (changing input mode does not fix
      attention allocation)
    - Periodic Injection (operates between tasks; attention
      dysfunction is within-task)
  variability: >
    Highly variable. Medication, environment, interest level,
    and fatigue all substantially modulate attention allocation.
  evidence: [C006, C007]
  does_not_explain: >
    Email or meeting memory failure. A person can be fully
    focused during a meeting (attention allocated correctly)
    and still fail to encode or remember commitments. Attention
    and encoding are separable deficits.
  note_on_distinction: >
    There is a risk that this mechanism restates the problem
    it explains (Inconsistent Focus). The distinction drawn:
    the problem is the functional manifestation at work; the
    mechanism is the underlying process that also produces
    hyperfocus. Hyperfocus is not a problem — it is the same
    mechanism in a different mode. This distinction may be thin.

Emotional Dysregulation:
  id: MECH06
  plain_language: >
    Heightened sensitivity to criticism, rejection, failure,
    and frustration. Shame responses that are faster and more
    intense than neurotypical. Fear of doing something wrong
    can prevent starting. Missing a day creates a shame spiral
    that prevents returning. Negative feedback hits harder and
    lasts longer.
  affects_problems:
    - Task Initiation Failure (the fear component — some
      initiation failure is driven by fear of doing it wrong,
      not insufficient activation)
    - Documentation Paralysis (anxiety about producing
      inadequate work)
  underlies_challenges:
    - Shame-Avoidance Spiral (directly — the spiral IS
      emotional dysregulation applied to product engagement)
    - Disclosure Constraint (disclosure anxiety is emotional
      dysregulation in the social domain)
  favours_models:
    - Passive Capture and Structured Delivery (works during
      absence — no shame for not showing up)
    - Ambient Monitor and Intervene (non-judgmental, graded
      intervention)
  disfavours_models:
    - Structured Check-In (missed sessions trigger shame;
      accumulated overdue items visible)
    - Calibration Feedback Loop (revealing estimation errors
      could trigger shame response)
  variability: >
    Highly variable. Stress, sleep deprivation, social context,
    and recent experiences of rejection or criticism all
    substantially modulate emotional reactivity.
  evidence: [C020, C021]
  does_not_explain: >
    Time perception or encoding. Emotional dysregulation
    amplifies the consequences of other deficits (missing a
    deadline feels catastrophic, which drives avoidance) but
    does not cause the underlying time or memory impairment.
  evidence_note: >
    Emotional dysregulation appears in practitioner evidence
    (P2C) and in the shame-spiral meta-challenge data, but is
    not directly included in the EF mediation analysis (P1C)
    which identified self-management-to-time and self-
    organisation as key mediators. This mechanism is supported
    by the evidence base but less established than Time
    Perception or Encoding Deficit.
