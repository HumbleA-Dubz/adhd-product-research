Time Estimation and Time Blindness:
  id: FP03
  plain_language: >
    Cannot perceive how much time has passed or accurately
    estimate how long things will take. Loses hours without
    noticing. Plans that assume a working sense of time fail
    consistently.

Deadline Misses:
  id: FP04
  plain_language: >
    Consistently fails to deliver work by agreed deadlines.
    Not from lack of effort but from misjudged time, focus
    lapses, and accumulated delays from upstream problems.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Task Initiation Failure:
  id: FP01
  plain_language: >
    Knows exactly what to do but cannot start. An "invisible
    barrier" that effort alone cannot overcome. Qualitatively
    different from procrastination — not avoidance of unpleasant
    work, but a neurological gate that blocks action regardless
    of intent.

Documentation and Administrative Paralysis:
  id: FP11
  plain_language: >
    Complete inability to start documentation tasks — timesheets,
    reports, meeting notes, evaluations. Low-stimulation plus
    high-effort creates the maximum initiation barrier. "Nothing
    makes it NOT paperwork."

Inconsistent Focus:
  id: FP02
  plain_language: >
    Unpredictable oscillation between near-zero productivity
    and hyperfocus. Not uniformly poor attention — the
    variability itself is the problem. What works Monday may
    fail Tuesday. Standard focus tools assume a consistent
    baseline that does not exist.

Attention-to-Detail Errors:
  id: FP06
  plain_language: >
    Persistent errors of oversight that survive repeated
    self-checking. Forgetting files, leaving debug code,
    sending incomplete work. The errors are identical to
    neurotypical mistakes but far more frequent and resistant
    to quality processes.

Prioritisation Failure:
  id: FP05
  plain_language: >
    Cannot use importance as a prioritisation criterion.
    Responds to interest, novelty, and urgency instead.
    "Procrastivity" — doing interesting low-priority tasks
    while important tasks stagnate.

Long-Term Project Neglect:
  id: FP08
  plain_language: >
    Strategic projects are abandoned or starved while daily
    operational work gets done. Driven by delay discounting
    (distant deadlines create zero urgency) and initiation
    failure (low-stimulation strategic work is hardest to
    start).

Meeting and Instruction Memory Failure:
  id: FP07
  plain_language: >
    Understands everything during a meeting but cannot recall
    it afterward. Not an attention problem — an encoding problem.
    Information is processed in real time but never reaches
    long-term storage. Standard note-taking creates a dual-task
    problem that worsens it.

Email and Communication Management Failure:
  id: FP09
  plain_language: >
    Reads emails, forms intention to reply, then the intention
    vanishes. Not inbox overwhelm — prospective memory failure.
    The "read and forgot" pattern. Standard email tools address
    volume and speed; none address forgotten reply intentions.

Context Switching Cost:
  id: FP10
  plain_language: >
    Recovery from interruptions takes 30+ minutes. Not just
    losing focus — losing the entire mental context that was
    built up during focused work. An environmental/workload
    interaction more than a core EF failure.

Workspace Disorganisation:
  id: FP18
  plain_language: >
    Cannot maintain organisation systems after initial setup.
    Desks, files, folders decay to disorder within days. The
    problem is sustained maintenance, not the initial sort.
