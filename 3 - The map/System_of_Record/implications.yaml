IMP01:
  name: No single model covers the full problem space
  type: structural_constraint
  statement: >
    No engagement model is "strongly compatible" with all six
    problem areas. Any product addressing the full problem space
    requires combining multiple engagement models. A single-
    model product will always leave gaps.
  evidence: [C032]
  derived_from: compatibility.yaml
  affects:
    - Product architecture decisions
    - Scope and sequencing decisions

IMP02:
  name: Product-initiated models are structurally advantaged
  type: structural_constraint
  statement: >
    Models where the product comes to the user (M1, M2, M6)
    are consistently less vulnerable to bootstrapping (MC2)
    and notification desensitisation (MC5) than models requiring
    user initiation (M3, M5, M7, M8). This is a structural
    advantage, not a design detail — it cannot be overcome by
    better UX on user-initiated models.
  evidence: [C019, C022, C025, C027]
  derived_from: compatibility.yaml (meta-challenge matrix)
  affects:
    - Engagement model prioritisation
    - Architecture decisions (push vs pull)

IMP03:
  name: Compounding value creates retention
  type: structural_constraint
  statement: >
    Models that become more valuable over time (M2's knowledge
    graph, M5's calibration data, M4's pattern learning) are
    more resistant to novelty decay (MC1) than models delivering
    fixed-value interactions (M7's check-in, M3's recording).
    Compounding value creates switching cost that counteracts
    the neurological impulse to abandon.
  evidence: [C022, C024, C028]
  derived_from: compatibility.yaml (meta-challenge matrix)
  affects:
    - Retention strategy
    - Build sequencing (compound-value components first)

IMP04:
  name: Background operation resolves shame and disclosure simultaneously
  type: structural_constraint
  statement: >
    Models that operate in the background (M1, M2, M6) are
    simultaneously resistant to shame (nothing to fall behind
    on) and disclosure (nothing visible to colleagues).
    Foreground models (M3, M5, M7) generate both shame
    artefacts and workplace visibility. This is two constraints
    resolved by one architectural choice.
  evidence: [C020, C022, C026]
  derived_from: compatibility.yaml (meta-challenge matrix)
  affects:
    - Architecture decisions (background vs foreground)
    - Enterprise and workplace deployment strategy

IMP05:
  name: The push-pull tension is irreducible
  type: structural_constraint
  statement: >
    Push-based delivery mitigates bootstrapping (MC2) but
    creates notification desensitisation vulnerability (MC5).
    Pull-based delivery avoids MC5 but creates MC2 vulnerability.
    The only resolution is embedding in existing workflows
    rather than using either push or pull as primary delivery —
    the "ambient presence" pattern (M2, M6).
  evidence: [C019, C025]
  derived_from: compatibility.yaml (meta-challenge matrix)
  affects:
    - Notification and delivery architecture
    - Integration strategy

IMP06:
  name: The practitioner-product paradox
  type: paradox
  statement: >
    Structured Check-In (M7) has the strongest practitioner
    recommendation alongside the worst meta-challenge profile.
    Practitioners provide external accountability that makes
    check-ins work — the practitioner IS the bootstrapping
    mechanism, the shame regulator, and the novelty source.
    Software cannot replicate these functions. M7 is viable
    only when combined with human elements (coaching, community)
    or layered on a passive foundation that handles the meta-
    challenges.
  evidence: [C029, C030, C031]
  derived_from: compatibility.yaml, engagement_models.yaml
  affects:
    - Whether to include structured check-in at all
    - Human-in-loop vs pure software decisions

IMP07:
  name: Strongest evidence matches narrowest applicability
  type: tension
  statement: >
    Passive Capture (M2) has the best meta-challenge profile
    and strongest clinical evidence (Tier 1 encoding/PM data),
    but is strongly compatible with only 2 of 6 problem areas
    (FP07, FP09). The broadest model (M1 Ambient Monitor) has
    weaker evidence and the highest privacy requirements.
    Depth of evidence inversely correlates with breadth of
    applicability.
  evidence: [C014, C015, C017, C028]
  derived_from: compatibility.yaml
  affects:
    - Product scope decisions
    - Evidence-based vs coverage-based prioritisation

IMP08:
  name: The medication baseline
  type: tension
  statement: >
    If 56% medication adherence and 50-70% first-year
    discontinuation are the baseline for the gold-standard
    intervention, digital tools should expect equal or worse
    retention. Any retention claim for a digital product that
    assumes better retention than medication needs strong
    justification. This reframes "how do we achieve retention"
    as "how do we deliver value assuming poor retention."
  evidence: [C024, C025]
  derived_from: meta_challenges.yaml (MC1)
  affects:
    - Retention strategy
    - Value delivery architecture (front-load vs compound)

IMP09:
  name: Seven foundations are direction-independent
  type: decision_boundary
  statement: >
    Seven shared capabilities appear across 3+ engagement models
    and are required regardless of product direction: calendar
    integration, task tool integration, non-shaming tone
    framework, variability engine, on-device processing, MCP
    backbone, and knowledge graph. These can be built with
    high confidence before direction is finalised.
  evidence: []
  derived_from: foundations.yaml
  affects:
    - Build sequencing
    - Resource allocation
    - "What to build now" decisions

IMP10:
  name: Meeting memory and email are the lowest-risk starting point
  type: decision_boundary
  statement: >
    FP07 (meeting memory) and FP09 (email) have the strongest
    clinical evidence (Tier 1), the widest market gap (zero
    ADHD-specific tools), the best-profiled engagement model
    (M2 with 0H vulnerabilities), and the simplest user
    behaviour requirement (zero effort). If risk minimisation
    is the objective, this is the starting cluster. The tradeoff
    is narrow applicability — only 2 of 13 problems are
    addressed.
  evidence: [C014, C015, C017, C018, C028]
  derived_from: compatibility.yaml, engagement_models.yaml
  affects:
    - Product scope decisions
    - MVP definition

IMP11:
  name: Task initiation is the highest-demand, highest-complexity target
  type: decision_boundary
  statement: >
    FP01 (task initiation) scores highest on frequency (5/5)
    and is the most-discussed user problem. But the most
    compatible model (M1 Ambient Monitor) has the highest
    privacy requirements, highest build complexity, and an
    unresolved "stuck vs thinking" detection problem. High
    demand, high risk. The alternative path through M4
    (Intelligent Reordering) is lower-risk but addresses
    initiation only partially.
  evidence: [C011, C012, C027]
  derived_from: compatibility.yaml, problems.yaml
  affects:
    - Product scope decisions
    - Technical risk assessment

IMP12:
  name: ADHD heterogeneity limits universal claims
  type: decision_boundary
  statement: >
    ADHD is heterogeneous. Engagement patterns, problem
    severity, and intervention response vary by subtype
    (inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, combined), comorbidity
    profile, medication status, and job type. The research does
    not differentiate by these factors. All claims in this
    system are averages across a heterogeneous population.
    Any product must account for this variability or narrow
    its target.
  evidence: [C033, C035]
  derived_from: claims.yaml (caveats)
  affects:
    - Target user definition
    - Personalisation requirements
    - Confidence in universal claims

IMP13:
  name: Retention predictions are untested
  type: decision_boundary
  statement: >
    Engagement model retention profiles are hypothesised from
    structural characteristics, not observed in longitudinal
    data. The only empirically supported retention finding is
    negative: Structured Check-In models are abandoned. Positive
    retention claims for other models (especially M2's
    "strongest retention") are structural inferences that need
    testing.
  evidence: [C034]
  derived_from: claims.yaml (caveats)
  affects:
    - Confidence in retention claims
    - Test design priorities
    - What to validate first
